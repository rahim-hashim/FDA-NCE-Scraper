( 2.1 ) Administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 60 hours (2.5 days) as follows ( 2.2 ): 0 to 4 hours: Initiate with a dosage of 30 mcg/kg/hour 4 to 24 hours: Increase dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour 24 to 52 hours: Increase dosage to 90 mcg/kg/hour (alternatively consider a dosage of 60 mcg/kg/hour for those who do not tolerate 90 mcg/kg/hour) 52 to 56 hours: Decrease dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour 56 to 60 hours: Decrease dosage to 30 mcg/kg/hour Dilution required prior to administration. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Considerations Prior to Initiating and During Therapy A healthcare provider must be available on site to continuously monitor the patient, and intervene as necessary, for the duration of the ZULRESSO infusion. Monitor patients for hypoxia using continuous pulse oximetry equipped with an alarm. Assess for excessive sedation every 2 hours during planned, non-sleep periods [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Initiate ZULRESSO treatment early enough during the day to allow for recognition of excessive sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage Administer ZULRESSO as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over a total of 60 hours (2.5 days) as follows: 0 to 4 hours: Initiate with a dosage of 30 mcg/kg/hour 4 to 24 hours: Increase dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour 24 to 52 hours: Increase dosage to 90 mcg/kg/hour (a reduction in dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour may be considered during this time period for patients who do not tolerate 90 mcg/kg/hour) 52 to 56 hours: Decrease dosage to 60 mcg/kg/hour 56 to 60 hours: Decrease dosage to 30 mcg/kg/hour If excessive sedation occurs at any time during the infusion, stop the infusion until the symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate. 2.3 Preparation and Storage Instructions ZULRESSO is supplied in vials as a concentrated solution that requires dilution prior to administration. After dilution, the product can be stored in infusion bags under refrigerated conditions for up to 96 hours. However, given that the diluted product can be used for only 12 hours at room temperature, each 60-hour infusion will require the preparation of at least five infusion bags. Prepare according to the following steps using aseptic technique: Visually inspect the vials of ZULRESSO for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. ZULRESSO is a clear, colorless solution. Do not use if the solution is discolored or particulate matter is present. The 60-hour infusion will generally require the preparation of five infusion bags. Additional bags will be needed for patients weighing ≥ 90 kg. For each infusion bag: Prepare and store in a polyolefin, non-DEHP, nonlatex bag, only. Dilute in the infusion bag immediately after the initial puncture of the drug product vial. Withdraw 20 mL of ZULRESSO from the vial and place in the infusion bag. Dilute with 40 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, and further dilute with 40 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (total volume of 100 mL) to achieve a target concentration of 1 mg/mL. Immediately place the infusion bag under refrigerated conditions until use. Diluted ZULRESSO storage instructions: If not used immediately after dilution, store under refrigerated conditions for up to 96 hours. Prolonged storage at room temperature may support adventitious microbial growth. Each prepared bag of diluted ZULRESSO may be used for up to 12 hours of infusion time at room temperature. Discard any unused ZULRESSO after 12 hours of infusion. 2.4 Administration Instructions ZULRESSO must be diluted before administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . The following are important administration instructions: Use a programmable peristaltic infusion pump to ensure accurate delivery of ZULRESSO. Administer ZULRESSO via a dedicated line. Do not inject other medications into the infusion bag or mix with ZULRESSO. Fully prime infusion administration sets with admixture before inserting into the pump and connecting to the venous catheter. Use a PVC, non-DEHP, nonlatex infusion set. Do not use in-line filter infusion sets. 2.5 Recommendations in Patients with End Stage Renal Disease Avoid use of ZULRESSO in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) with eGFR of < 15 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 because of the potential accumulation of the solubilizing agent, betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 , 12.6 )] .']","['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection: 100 mg/20 mL (5 mg/mL) clear, colorless solution in a single-dose vial.

( 5.3 ) 5.1 Excessive Sedation and Sudden Loss of Consciousness In clinical studies in adults, ZULRESSO caused sedation and somnolence that required dose interruption or reduction in some patients during the infusion (5% of ZULRESSO-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients). Some adult patients were also reported to have loss of consciousness or altered state of consciousness during the ZULRESSO infusion (4% of the ZULRESSO-treated patients compared with 0% of the placebo-treated patients). Time to full recovery from loss or altered state of consciousness, after dose interruption, ranged from 15 to 60 minutes in clinical studies in adults. A healthy 55-year-old man participating in a cardiac repolarization study experienced severe somnolence and <1 minute of apnea while receiving two times the maximum recommended dosage of ZULRESSO (180 mcg/kg/hour). In an open-label clinical study in 20 patients ages 15 to 17 years, one patient experienced dizziness and loss of consciousness. All patients with loss of or altered state of consciousness recovered with dose interruption. There was no clear association between loss or alteration of consciousness and pattern or timing of dose. Not all patients who experienced a loss or alteration of consciousness reported sedation or somnolence before the episode. During the infusion, monitor patients for sedative effects every 2 hours during planned, non-sleep periods. Immediately stop the infusion if there are signs or symptoms of excessive sedation. After symptoms resolve, the infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Immediately stop the infusion if pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia. After hypoxia, the infusion should not be resumed. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving after infusion until any sedative effects of ZULRESSO have dissipated. Patients must be accompanied during interactions with their child(ren) while receiving the infusion because of the potential for excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness. Concomitant use of opioids, antidepressants, or other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines or alcohol may increase the likelihood or severity of adverse reactions related to sedation [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Because of the risk of serious harm resulting from excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness, ZULRESSO is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ZULRESSO REMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 5.2 ZULRESSO Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) ZULRESSO is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the ZULRESSO REMS because excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness can result in serious harm [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Notable requirements of the ZULRESSO REMS include the following: Healthcare facilities must enroll in the program and ensure that ZULRESSO is only administered to patients who are enrolled in the ZULRESSO REMS. Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense ZULRESSO to healthcare facilities who are certified in the ZULRESSO REMS. Patients must be enrolled in the ZULRESSO REMS prior to administration of ZULRESSO. Wholesalers and distributors must be registered with the program and must only distribute to certified healthcare facilities and pharmacies. Further information, including a list of certified healthcare facilities, is available at www.zulressorems.com or 1-844-472-4379. 5.3 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of chronically administered antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1 . Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric ZULRESSO is not approved in patients less than 15 years old. and Adult Patients Age Range (years) Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional patients 18-24 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer patient ZULRESSO does not directly affect monoaminergic systems. Because of this and the comparatively low number of exposures to ZULRESSO, the risk of developing suicidal thoughts and behaviors with ZULRESSO is unknown. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including discontinuing ZULRESSO, in patients whose depression becomes worse or who experience emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors.']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Excessive Sedation and Sudden Loss of Consciousness [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were sedation/somnolence, dry mouth, loss of consciousness, and flushing/hot flush. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sage Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-844-4-SAGERX (1-844-472-4379) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of ZULRESSO was evaluated in 140 adult patients with postpartum depression (PPD). A titration to a target dosage of 90 mcg/kg/hour was evaluated in 102 adult patients and a titration to a target dose of 60 mcg/kg/hour was evaluated in 38 adult patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Patients were then followed for 4 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were sedation/somnolence, dry mouth, loss of consciousness, and flushing/hot flush ( Table 2 ). Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation, Dosage Interruption, or Dosage Reduction In the pooled placebo controlled-studies in adults, the incidence of patients who discontinued due to any adverse reaction was 2% of ZULRESSO-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in ZULRESSO-treated patients were sedation-related (loss of consciousness, vertigo, syncope, and presyncope) or infusion site pain. In the pooled placebo controlled-studies in adults, the incidence of patients who had an interruption or reduction of the dosage due to any adverse reaction was 7% of ZULRESSO-treated patients compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions leading to dose reduction or interruption in ZULRESSO-treated patients were sedation-related (loss of consciousness, syncope, somnolence, dizziness, fatigue), infusion site events, changes in blood pressure, or medication error due to infusion pump malfunction. Three ZULRESSO-treated patients who had a dosage interruption because of loss of consciousness subsequently resumed and completed treatment after resolution of symptoms; two patients who had dosage interruption because of loss of consciousness did not resume the infusion. Table 2 presents the adverse reactions that occurred in ZULRESSO-treated adult PPD patients at a rate of at least 2% and at a higher rate than in the placebo-treated patients during the 60-hour treatment period.

( 8.1 ) Avoid use in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants/ . Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies of other drugs that enhance GABAergic inhibition, ZULRESSO may cause fetal harm. Available data from case reports with ZULRESSO use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, malformations were not seen in rats or rabbits at plasma levels up to 5 and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. Developmental toxicities were seen in the fetuses of rats and rabbits at 5 and ≥3 times the plasma levels at the MRHD, respectively. Reproductive toxicities were seen in rabbits at ≥3 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. These effects were not seen in rats and rabbits at 2 and 1.2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. Brexanolone administered to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in lower pup survival at doses which were associated with ≥2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD and a neurobehavioral deficit in female offspring at 5 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. These effects were not seen at 0.8 times and 2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD, respectively (see Data ) . In published animal studies, administration of other drugs that enhance GABAergic inhibition to neonatal rats caused widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain. The window of vulnerability to these changes in rats (postnatal days 0-14) corresponds to the period of brain development that takes place during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In pregnant rats and rabbits, no malformations were seen when brexanolone was given during the period of organogenesis at continuous intravenous doses up to 60 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses were associated with maternal plasma levels 5 and 6 times the plasma levels at the MRHD of 90 mcg/kg/hour, in rats and rabbits, respectively. In rats, a decrease in fetal body weights was seen at 60 mg/kg/day (5 times the plasma level at the MRHD). In rabbits, increased numbers of late resorptions and a decrease in fetal body weights were seen at doses equal to and greater than 15 mg/kg/day (3 times the plasma levels at the MRHD) with fewer live fetuses and a higher post implantation loss seen at 30 mg/kg/day (6 times the plasma levels at the MRHD) in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain and/or body weight loss). Effects in rats and rabbits were not seen at 2 and 1.2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD, respectively. When brexanolone was administered to pregnant rats by continuous intravenous administration at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (2 and 5 times plasma levels at the MRHD, respectively) during the period of organogenesis and throughout pregnancy and lactation, increased numbers of dead pups and fewer live pups at birth were seen. This effect was not seen at 0.8 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. Decreased pup viability between postnatal day 0 and 4 in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and food consumption during lactation) was seen at 5 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. These effects were not seen at 2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. A neurobehavioral deficit, characterized by slower habituation in the maximal startle response in the auditory startle test, was seen in female offspring of dams dosed at 5 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. This effect was not seen at 2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Available data from a lactation study in 12 adult women indicate that brexanolone is transferred to breastmilk in nursing mothers. However, the relative infant dose (RID) is low, 1% to 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage (see Data ) . Also, as ZULRESSO has low oral bioavailability (<5%) in adults, infant exposure is expected to be low. There were no reports of effects of ZULRESSO on milk production. There are no data on the effects of ZULRESSO on a breastfed infant. Available data on the use of ZULRESSO during lactation do not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions to breastfed infants from exposure to ZULRESSO. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ZULRESSO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZULRESSO or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A study was conducted in twelve healthy adult lactating women treated with intravenous ZULRESSO according to the recommended 60-hour dosing regimen (maximum dosage was 90 mcg/kg/hour). Concentrations of ZULRESSO in breast milk were at low levels (<10 ng/mL) in >95% of women by 36 hours after the end of the infusion of ZULRESSO. The calculated maximum relative infant dose for ZULRESSO during the infusion was 1% to 2%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ZULRESSO for the treatment of PPD have been established in patients 15 to 17 years. Use of ZULRESSO in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with PPD, pharmacokinetic data in adults and patients 15 to 17 years, and safety data in patients 15 to 17 years [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The safety and effectiveness of ZULRESSO in patients less than 15 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use PPD is a condition associated with pregnancy; there is no geriatric experience with ZULRESSO. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. Modest increases in exposure to unbound brexanolone and modest decreases in exposure to total brexanolone were observed in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh≥7) with no associated change in tolerability [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) or severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid use of ZULRESSO in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) with eGFR of < 15 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 because of the potential accumulation of the solubilizing agent, betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 , 12.6 )] .""]","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy.

In rabbits, increased numbers of late resorptions and a decrease in fetal body weights were seen at doses equal to and greater than 15 mg/kg/day (3 times the plasma levels at the MRHD) with fewer live fetuses and a higher post implantation loss seen at 30 mg/kg/day (6 times the plasma levels at the MRHD) in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain and/or body weight loss). Effects in rats and rabbits were not seen at 2 and 1.2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD, respectively. When brexanolone was administered to pregnant rats by continuous intravenous administration at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (2 and 5 times plasma levels at the MRHD, respectively) during the period of organogenesis and throughout pregnancy and lactation, increased numbers of dead pups and fewer live pups at birth were seen. This effect was not seen at 0.8 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. Decreased pup viability between postnatal day 0 and 4 in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and food consumption during lactation) was seen at 5 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. These effects were not seen at 2 times the plasma levels at the MRHD. A neurobehavioral deficit, characterized by slower habituation in the maximal startle response in the auditory startle test, was seen in female offspring of dams dosed at 5 times the plasma levels at the MRHD.

The molecular formula of brexanolone is C 21 H 34 O 2 . The relative molecular mass is 318.5 Da. The chemical structure is: ZULRESSO (brexanolone) injection is a sterile, clear, colorless, and preservative-free solution. ZULRESSO 5 mg/mL is hypertonic and must be diluted prior to administration as an intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Each mL of solution contains 5 mg of brexanolone, 250 mg of betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium, 0.265 mg of citric acid monohydrate, 2.57 mg of sodium citrate dihydrate, and water for injection. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be used during manufacturing to adjust pH. Chemical Structure']","['12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of brexanolone in the treatment of PPD is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its positive allosteric modulation of GABA A receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Brexanolone potentiated GABA-mediated currents from recombinant human GABA A receptors in mammalian cells expressing α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptor subunits, α 4 β 3 δ receptor subunits, and α 6 β 3 δ receptor subunits. Brexanolone exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of brexanolone on the QT interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo and positive controlled, double-blind, three-period crossover thorough QT study in 30 healthy adult subjects. At 1.9-times the exposure occurring at the highest recommended infusion rate (90 mcg/kg/hour), brexanolone did not prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Brexanolone exhibited dose proportional pharmacokinetics over a dosage range of 30 mcg/kg/hour to 270 mcg/kg/hour (three times the maximum recommended dosage). Mean steady state exposure at 60 mcg/kg/hour and 90 mcg/kg/hour was around 52 ng/mL and 79 ng/mL, respectively. Distribution The volume of distribution of brexanolone was approximately 3 L/kg, suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding was greater than 99% and is independent of plasma concentrations. Elimination The terminal half-life of brexanolone is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance of brexanolone is approximately 1 L/h/kg. Metabolism Brexanolone is extensively metabolized by non-CYP based pathways via three main routes - keto-reduction (AKRs), glucuronidation (UGTs), and sulfation (SULTs). There are three major circulating metabolites that are pharmacologically inactive and do not contribute to the overall efficacy of ZULRESSO. Excretion Following administration of radiolabeled brexanolone, 47% was recovered in feces (primarily as metabolites) and 42% in urine (with less than 1% as unchanged brexanolone). Specific Populations Patients 15 to 17 years Brexanolone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 20 patients with PPD (15 to 17 years) and were comparable to those in adult patients with PPD. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brexanolone were observed based on renal impairment (severe) study or hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) study. The effect of end stage renal disease (ESRD, eGFR < 15 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) on brexanolone pharmacokinetics is unknown. However, avoid use of ZULRESSO in patients with ESRD [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Drug Interaction Studies No studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of other drugs on ZULRESSO. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate) were observed when it was used concomitantly with brexanolone. 12.6 Betadex Sulfobutyl Ether Sodium Pharmacokinetics Betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is a solubilizing agent in ZULRESSO. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ), betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium AUC inf increased 5.5-fold and C max increased 1.7-fold.

In these studies, patients received a 60-hour continuous intravenous infusion of ZULRESSO or placebo and were then followed for 4 weeks. Study 1 (NCT02942004) included patients with severe PPD (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score ≥ 26), and Study 2 (NCT02942017) included patients with moderate PPD (HAM-D score of 20 to 25). A titration to the recommended target dosage of 90 mcg/kg/hour was evaluated in both studies (patients received 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours, 60 mcg/kg/hour for 20 hours, 90 mcg/kg/hour for 28 hours, followed by a taper to 60 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours and then 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours). A titration to a target dosage of 60 mcg/kg/hour (patients received 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours, 60 mcg/kg/hour for 52 hours, then 30 mcg/kg/hour for 4 hours) was also evaluated in Study 1. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally similar across treatment groups in the pooled Studies 1 and 2. Most patients were White (63%) or Black (34%); 18% of patients identified as Hispanic or Latina; the average age of women receiving ZULRESSO was 28 years. Most patients (76%) had onset of PPD symptoms within 4 weeks after delivery, with the remainder having onset during the third trimester. Baseline oral antidepressant use was reported for 23% of patients. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in depressive symptoms as measured by the HAM-D total score at the end of the infusion (Hour 60). A pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in HAM-D total score at Day 30. In both placebo-controlled studies, titration to a target dose of ZULRESSO 90 mcg/kg/hour was superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms. In a group of 38 patients in Study 1, a ZULRESSO titration to a target dose of 60 mcg/kg/hour was also superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms.

ZULRESSO can cause serious side effects, including: Excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness. ZULRESSO may cause you to feel very sleepy (excessive sedation) or pass out (loss of consciousness). Your healthcare provider should check you for symptoms of excessive sleepiness every 2 hours while you are awake. During your ZULRESSO infusion, tell your healthcare provider right away if you feel like you cannot stay awake during the time you are normally awake or if you feel like you are going to pass out. Your healthcare provider may lower your dose or stop the infusion until your symptoms go away. You must have a caregiver or family member with you to help care for your child(ren) during your ZULRESSO infusion. Because of the risk of serious harm resulting from excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness, ZULRESSO is only available through a restricted program called the ZULRESSO REMS.

( 1 )'],"['2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer with fat-containing food. ( 2.1 ) Recommended dosage is 50 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days. ( 2.1 ) Dosage may be reduced to 40 mg once daily if CNS depressant effects occur. ( 2.1 ) ZURZUVAE can be used alone or as an adjunct to oral antidepressant therapy. ( 2.1 ) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Recommended dosage is 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days. ( 2.3 , 8.6 ) Moderate or Severe Renal Impairment: Recommended dosage is 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days. ( 2.4 , 8.7 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of ZURZUVAE is 50 mg taken orally once daily in the evening for 14 days. Administer ZURZUVAE with fat-containing food (e.g., 400 to 1,000 calories, 25% to 50% fat) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If patients experience CNS depressant effects within the 14-day period, consider reducing the dosage to 40 mg once daily in the evening within the 14-day period. ZURZUVAE can be used alone or as an adjunct to oral antidepressant therapy. The safety and effectiveness of ZURZUVAE use beyond 14 days in a single treatment course have not been established. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inducers or CYP3A4 Inhibitors CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Reduce the ZURZUVAE dosage to 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days when used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. No dosage modification is recommended when ZURZUVAE is concomitantly used with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of ZURZUVAE in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) is 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The recommended dosage in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment is the same as those in patients with normal hepatic function. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment The recommended dosage of ZURZUVAE in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The recommended dosage in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is the same as those in patients with normal renal function. 2.5 Recommendations Regarding a Missed Dose If a ZURZUVAE evening dose is missed, take the next dose at the regular time the following evening. Do not take extra capsules on the same day to make up for the missed dose. Continue taking ZURZUVAE once daily until the remainder of the 14-day treatment course is completed.']","['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Capsules: 20 mg: light-orange cap, ivory to light-yellow body, printed with “S-217 20 mg” on body of capsule in black 25 mg: light-orange cap, light-orange body, printed with “S-217 25 mg” on body of capsule in black 30 mg: orange cap, light-orange body, printed with “S-217 30 mg” on body of capsule in black Capsules: 20 mg, 25 mg, and 30 mg. ( 3 )']",['4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. None. ( 4 )'],"['5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CNS Depressant Effects: ZURZUVAE can cause CNS depressant effects such as somnolence and confusion. If patients develop CNS depression, consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of ZURZUVAE. ( 5.2 ) Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior: Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including discontinuing ZURZUVAE, in patients whose PPD worsens, or who experience emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-fetal Toxicity: May cause fetal harm. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to an infant exposed to ZURZUVAE in utero. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during ZURZUVAE treatment and for one week after the final dose. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Impaired Ability to Drive or Engage in Other Potentially Hazardous Activities ZURZUVAE causes driving impairment due to central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . In two driving simulation studies, the driving ability of healthy adults was impaired in a dose-dependent manner following repeat nighttime administration of 30 mg of ZURZUVAE (0.6 times the recommended dose) for five days as well as 50 mg of ZURZUVAE (recommended dose) for seven days [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Advise patients not to drive a motor vehicle or engage in other potentially hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery, until at least 12 hours after ZURZUVAE administration for the duration of the 14-day treatment course. Inform patients that they may not be able to assess their own driving competence or the degree of driving impairment caused by ZURZUVAE. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depressant Effects ZURZUVAE can cause CNS depressant effects such as somnolence and confusion. In Study 1, 36% of patients who received 50 mg of ZURZUVAE and 6% of patients who received placebo daily developed somnolence. In Study 2, 19% of patients who received another zuranolone capsule formulation (approximately equivalent to 40 mg of ZURZUVAE) and 11% of patients who received placebo daily developed somnolence [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. In each clinical study, some ZURZUVAE-treated patients developed confusional state. One of these cases was severe, and was also associated with somnolence, dizziness, and gait disturbance. A higher percentage of ZURZUVAE-treated patients, compared to placebo-treated patients, experienced somnolence, dizziness, or confusion that required dosage reduction, interruption, or discontinuation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Because ZURZUVAE can cause CNS depressant effects, patients may be at higher risk of falls. Other CNS depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs that increase zuranolone concentration, may increase impairment of psychomotor performance or CNS depressant effects such as somnolence, cognitive impairment, and the risk of respiratory depression in ZURZUVAE-treated patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . To reduce the risk of CNS depressant effects and/or mitigate CNS depressant effects that occurs with ZURZUVAE treatment: If patients develop CNS depressant effects, consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of ZURZUVAE [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . If use with another CNS depressant is unavoidable, consider dosage reduction. Reduce the ZURZUVAE dosage in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.3 Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of chronically administered antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1 . Table 1 Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric * and Adult Patients Age Range (years) Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated * ZURZUVAE is not approved in pediatric patients. Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional patients 18-24 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer patient ZURZUVAE does not directly affect monoaminergic systems. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including discontinuing ZURZUVAE, in patients whose depression becomes worse or who experience emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 5.4 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies, ZURZUVAE may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In rat studies following exposure during gestation or throughout gestation and lactation, adverse effects on development (fetal malformations, embryofetal and offspring mortality, growth deficits) were observed. In addition, neuronal death was observed in rats exposed to zuranolone during a period of brain development that in humans begins during the third trimester of pregnancy and continues during the first few years after birth [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.2 )]. Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to an infant exposed to ZURZUVAE in utero. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZURZUVAE and for one week after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )].']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Impaired Ability to Drive or Engage in Other Potentially Hazardous Activities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Central Nervous System Depressant Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo) were somnolence, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biogen at 1-844-987-9882 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ZURZUVAE for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) was evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical studies in 347 women with PPD treated with 50 mg of ZURZUVAE (Study 1), or with another zuranolone capsule formulation approximately equivalent to 40 mg of ZURZUVAE (Study 2) once daily for 14 days [Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. The studies included adult patients age 18 to 44 years diagnosed with PPD. Across PPD clinical studies at all doses studied (Studies 1 and 2), serious adverse reactions included confusional state (1%) [Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. In Study 1, the incidence of adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in patients treated with 50 mg of ZURZUVAE and placebo was 2% and 1%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation in ZURZUVAE-treated patients was somnolence. Dosage reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of ZURZUVAE-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction in ZURZUVAE-treated patients were somnolence (10%) and dizziness (6%). The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and greater than placebo) in ZURZUVAE-treated patients were somnolence, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and urinary tract infection. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of patients with PPD treated with 50 mg of ZURZUVAE and at a higher incidence than in patients who received placebo in Study 1.

The adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation was somnolence. Dosage reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4% of zuranolone-treated patients. The adverse reactions that led to dosage reduction were somnolence and confusional state. The most common (≥5% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions in zuranolone-treated patients were somnolence, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, fatigue, and diarrhea.

Table 4 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with ZURZUVAE CNS Depressant Drugs and Alcohol Clinical Impact Due to additive pharmacological effects, the concomitant use of CNS depressant drugs, including alcohol, may increase impairment of psychomotor performance or CNS depressant effects. Management If use with another CNS depressant is unavoidable, consider dosage reduction. Caution should be used when ZURZUVAE is administered in combination with other CNS drugs or alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the exposure of zuranolone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of ZURZUVAE-associated adverse reactions. Management Reduce the ZURZUVAE dosage when used with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with a CYP3A4 inducer decreases the exposure of zuranolone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce the efficacy of ZURZUVAE. Management Avoid concomitant use of ZURZUVAE with CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. CNS Depressants: Concomitant use may increase impairment of psychomotor performance or CNS depressant effects. If use with another CNS depressant is unavoidable, consider dosage reduction. ( 7 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Concomitant use may increase the risk of ZURZUVAE-associated adverse reactions. Reduce the ZURZUVAE dosage to 30 mg orally once daily in the evening for 14 days when used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. ( 2.2 , 7 ) CYP3A4 Inducers: Concomitant use may decrease the efficacy of ZURZUVAE. Avoid concomitant use. ( 2.2 , 7 )']","[""8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants, including ZURZUVAE, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants/ Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies, ZURZUVAE may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Available data on ZURZUVAE use in pregnant women from the clinical development program are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animals, oral administration of zuranolone to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in developmental toxicity, including embryofetal death and fetal malformations, with a no adverse effect level (NOAEL) associated with maternal plasma exposures 7 times greater than in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 50 mg. Oral administration of zuranolone to rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in developmental toxicity in the offspring, including, perinatal mortality, at maternal exposures similar to that in humans at the MRHD. Developmental toxicity was observed at doses that were also maternally toxic. Neuronal death was observed in rats exposed to zuranolone during a period of brain development that begins during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans and continues up to a few years after birth. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of zuranolone (0, 2.5, 7.5, or 22.5 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of fetal malformations, reductions in embryofetal survival, and reduced fetal body weights as well as maternal mortality and sedation at the highest dose. The no effect dose (7.5 mg/kg/day) for adverse effects on embryofetal development was associated with maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 7 times that in humans at the MRHD of 50 mg. Potential adverse effects of zuranolone on embryofetal development in pregnant rabbits were not adequately assessed. Oral administration of zuranolone (0, 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg/day) to rats throughout pregnancy and into lactation resulted in increased perinatal mortality and persistent bodyweight reductions in the offspring at the mid and high doses, which also produced maternal mortality and adverse clinical signs. The no-effect dose (1 mg/kg/day) for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats was associated with maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 2 times that in the humans at the MRHD. Oral administration of a single dose of zuranolone (0, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/kg) to rats on postnatal day 7 resulted in increased apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose (2.5 mg/kg) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) comparable to that in humans at the MRHD. Brain development on PND 7 in rats corresponds to a period of brain development that begins during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans and continue up to a few years after birth. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Available data from a clinical lactation study in 14 women indicate that zuranolone is present in low levels in human milk (see Data ). There are no data on the effects of zuranolone on a breastfed infant and limited data on the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ZURZUVAE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZURZUVAE or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A steady-state milk study was conducted in 14 healthy lactating women treated with daily oral administration of 30 mg of ZURZUVAE for 5 days. At steady state (Day 5), the calculated maximum relative infant dose for ZURZUVAE was < 1%. The daily infant dose was low (approximately 0.0013 mg/kg/day), reflecting a mean relative infant dose of 0.357% compared to the maternal dose. Concentrations of ZURZUVAE in breastmilk were below the level of quantification limit (BQL) by 4-6 days after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal studies, ZURZUVAE may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Contraception Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZURZUVAE and for one week after the final dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ZURZUVAE in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use PPD is a condition associated with pregnancy; there is no geriatric experience with ZURZUVAE in patients with PPD. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Exposure to zuranolone was increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The recommended ZURZUVAE dosage in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) is lower than patients with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The recommended ZURZUVAE dosage in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh B) is the same as those with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Exposure to zuranolone was increased in patients with moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and severe (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The recommended ZURZUVAE dosage in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment is lower than those with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . The recommended dosage in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) is the same as those in patients with normal renal function. ZURZUVAE has not been studied in patients with eGFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or patients requiring dialysis.""]","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants, including ZURZUVAE, during pregnancy.

Psychomotor Performance with Alcohol or Alprazolam Co-administration of repeated 50 mg daily doses of ZURZUVAE with alcohol or alprazolam led to impairment in psychomotor performance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Zuranolone exposure (C max and AUC) increased approximately dose proportionally with doses ranging from 30 mg to 60 mg (1.2 times of the recommended dosage of ZURZUVAE) with a moderate-fat meal (700 calories; 30% fat). Once-daily administration of ZURZUVAE resulted in accumulation of approximately 1.5-fold in systemic exposures and steady state was achieved in 3 to 5 days. Absorption Following oral administration, peak zuranolone concentrations occur at 5 to 6 hours (T max ). The absolute bioavailability of ZURZUVAE was not evaluated. Effect of Food Following administration of 30 mg of ZURZUVAE to healthy subjects, the C max increased by approximately 3.5-fold and the AUC last increased by approximately 1.8-fold with a low-fat meal (400 to 500 calories, 25% fat) compared to fasted conditions. The C max increased by approximately 4.3-fold and the AUC last increased by approximately 2-fold with a high-fat meal (800 to 1,000 calories, 50% fat) compared to fasted conditions. The T max was not impacted by food. Distribution The volume of distribution of zuranolone following oral administration is greater than 500 L. The mean blood-to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.54 to 0.58. Plasma protein binding is greater than 99.5%. Elimination The terminal half-life of zuranolone is approximately 19.7 to 24.6 hours in an adult population. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of zuranolone is 33 L/h. Metabolism Zuranolone undergoes extensive metabolism, with CYP3A4 identified as a primary enzyme involved. There were no circulating human metabolites greater than 10% of total drug-related materials and none are considered to contribute to the therapeutic effects of zuranolone. Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled zuranolone, 45% of the dose was recovered in urine as metabolites with negligible unchanged zuranolone and 41% in feces as metabolites with less than 2% as unchanged zuranolone. Specific Populations Racial Groups Black or African American participants had a 14% higher CL/F compared to participants of other races (Asian, White, or other). Male and Female Patients, Patients with Renal Impairment, Patients with Hepatic Impairment Exposures of zuranolone in specific populations are summarized in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] .

In these studies, concomitant use of existing oral antidepressants was allowed for patients taking a stable dose of oral antidepressant for at least 30 days before baseline. These studies included patients with HAMD-17 scores ≥ 26 at baseline. In Study 1, patients received 50 mg of ZURZUVAE (N=98) or placebo (N=97) once daily in the evening with fat-containing food for 14 days, with the option to reduce the dosage based on tolerability to 40 mg once daily of ZURZUVAE or placebo. The patients were followed for a minimum of 4 weeks after the 14-day treatment course. In Study 2, patients received another zuranolone capsule formulation (approximately equivalent to 40 mg of ZURZUVAE) (N=76) or placebo (N=74) once daily in the evening with food for 14 days. The patients were followed for a minimum of 4 weeks after the 14-day treatment course. Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics In Studies 1 and 2, the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of patients were similar between the ZURZUVAE and placebo groups. In Study 1, patients had a mean age of 30 years (range 19 to 44 years); were 70% White, 22% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 7% were other races; and 38% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Baseline use of stable oral antidepressants was reported in 15% of patients. In Study 2, patients had a mean age of 28 years (range 18 to 44 years); were 56% White, 41% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 2% were other races; and 23% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Baseline use of stable oral antidepressants was reported in 19% of patients. The primary endpoint for Studies 1 and 2 was the change from baseline in depressive symptoms as measured by the HAMD-17 total score at Day 15. In these studies, patients in the ZURZUVAE groups experienced statistically significantly greater improvement on the primary endpoint compared to patients in the placebo groups, as shown in Table 5 . For Study 1, the key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in HAMD-17 total score at Days 3, 28, and 45. Table 5 Results for the Primary Endpoint: Change from Baseline in the HAMD-17 Total Score at Day 15 (Studies 1 and 2 in Women with PPD) HAMD-17: 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale; SD: standard deviation; LS: least squares; SE: standard error; CI: confidence interval * This capsule formulation of zuranolone is approximately equivalent to 40 mg of ZURZUVAE.

Figure 3 Mean Change from Baseline in HAM-D Total Score Over Time (Days) in Women with PPD in Study 1 * Both phases were double-blind. Figure 3 14.2 Effects on Driving Two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, four-way crossover studies (Study 3 and Study 4) evaluated the effects of nighttime ZURZUVAE administration on next-morning driving performance, 9 hours after dosing, using a computer-based driving simulation. Study 3 In Study 3, 50 mg of ZURZUVAE was administered for six consecutive nights and on the seventh night a single dose of 50 mg or 100 mg (two times the recommended dose) was administered. The primary driving performance outcome measure was the change in Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) (a measure of driving impairment) in the ZURZUVAE group compared to the placebo group on Days 2 and 8 (after a single dose and repeat doses, respectively). Study 3 included 67 healthy participants. The median age was 45 years old (age ranged from 22 to 81 years old; 7 participants were ≥ 65 years of age); there were 38 males and 29 females; 88% were White, 5% were Black or African American, 3% were Asian, and 5% were other races; and 12% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. A single 50 mg dose of ZURZUVAE caused statistically significant impairment in next-morning driving performance compared to placebo. Statistically significant effects on driving were also observed on Day 8 following daily administration of 50 mg of ZURZUVAE. Administration of 100 mg of ZURZUVAE (twice the maximum recommended dose) on the final night increased impairment in driving ability [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . The exposure-response analysis for driving impairment in Study 3 suggested that the projected mean placebo-adjusted SDLP at 12 hours post-dose would be less than the threshold associated with driving impairment. Study 4 In Study 4, 30 mg of ZURZUVAE (0.6 times the maximum recommended daily dose) was administered for four consecutive nights and on the fifth night a single dose of 30 mg or 60 mg (1.2 times the recommended daily dose) was administered. The primary driving performance outcome measure was the change in SDLP in the ZURZUVAE group compared to the placebo group on Days 2 and 6 (after a single dose and repeat doses, respectively). Study 4 included 60 participants; 60% and 40% were male and female, respectively; the median age was 41 years old (range was 22 to 62 years old); 90% were White, 5% were Black or African American, 3% were Asian, and 2% were other races; and 15% were of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. A single 30 mg dose of ZURZUVAE caused a statistically significant impairment in next-morning driving performance compared to placebo. The mean effect on driving performance was not statistically significantly different following 30 mg of ZURZUVAE compared to placebo on Day 6; however, driving ability was impaired in some participants taking ZURZUVAE. Administration of 60 mg of ZURZUVAE (1.2 times the maximum recommended dose) on the final night caused statistically significant impairment in next-morning driving performance compared to placebo [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .']","['<table ID=""t5"" width=""100%""><caption>Table 5 Results for the Primary Endpoint: Change from Baseline in the HAMD-17 Total Score at Day 15 (Studies 1 and 2 in Women with PPD) </caption><col width=""10.950%"" align=""left""/><col width=""33.983%"" align=""left""/><col width=""5.500%"" align=""left""/><col width=""12.850%"" align=""left""/><col width=""17.433%"" align=""left""/><col width=""19.283%"" align=""left""/><tfoot><tr><td colspan=""6"" align=""left"" valign=""top""><paragraph styleCode=""footnote"">HAMD-17: 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale; SD: standard deviation; LS: least squares; SE: standard error; CI: confidence interval </paragraph></td></tr><tr><td colspan=""6"" align=""left"" valign=""top""><paragraph styleCode=""footnote""><sup>*</sup>This capsule formulation of zuranolone is approximately equivalent to 40 mg of ZURZUVAE. </paragraph></td></tr></tfoot><tbody><tr><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Lrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Study Number</content></td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Treatment Group</content></td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">N</content></td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Mean Baseline Score (SD)</content></td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">LS Mean Change from Baseline (SE)</content></td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Placebo- subtracted Difference</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">(95% CI)</content></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=""2"" align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">1</content></td><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">50 mg of ZURZUVAE </td><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">98 </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">28.6 (2.49) </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-15.6 (0.82) </td><td rowspan=""2"" align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-4.0 (-6.3, -1.7) </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">Placebo </td><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">97 </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">28.8 (2.34) </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-11.6 (0.82) </td></tr><tr><td rowspan=""2"" align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">2</content></td><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">Zuranolone (another capsule formulation)<sup>*</sup></td><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">76 </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">28.4 (2.09) </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-17.8 (1.04) </td><td rowspan=""2"" align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-4.2 (-6.9, -1.5) </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">Placebo </td><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">74 </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">28.8 (2.32) </td><td align=""left"" valign=""middle"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-13.6 (1.07) </td></tr></tbody></table>']","['16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING How Supplied ZURZUVAE (zuranolone) is supplied as 20 mg, 25 mg, and 30 mg capsules as follows: Capsule Strength Capsule Colors Capsule Markings Packaging Configuration NDC 20 mg light-orange cap ivory to light-yellow body Black “S-217 20 mg” on body Bottle of 14 64406-029-01 25 mg light-orange cap light-orange body Black “S-217 25 mg” on body Bottle of 14 64406-030-01 Blister pack of 28 64406-030-02 30 mg orange cap light-orange body Black “S-217 30 mg” on body Bottle of 14 64406-031-01 Storage Store at room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].']","['17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ).

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desired psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Individuals with a history of drug abuse or substance use disorders may be at a greater risk of these outcomes with ZURZUVAE. In a human abuse potential study, single oral doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg of ZURZUVAE (0.6 times, 1.2 times, and 1.8 times the recommended daily dose, respectively) were compared to single oral doses of alprazolam (1.5 mg and 3 mg) and placebo in healthy, nondependent individuals with a history of recreational CNS depressant use. The study demonstrated that ZURZUVAE has dose-dependent abuse potential comparable to alprazolam and greater abuse potential than placebo on positive subjective measures of “drug liking,” “overall drug liking,” “take drug again,” “high,” and “good drug effects.” In the human abuse potential study, dose-dependent, abuse-related adverse reactions, including euphoric mood, feeling drunk, and somnolence, were reported with ZURZUVAE use. 9.3 Dependence ZURZUVAE may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Adverse reactions reported upon discontinuation of zuranolone in healthy subjects who received 50 mg of zuranolone for 5 to 7 days (on the 7 th day subjects received 50 mg or 100 mg ) included: insomnia, palpitations, decreased appetite, nightmare, nausea, hyperhidrosis, and paranoia. These adverse reactions indicate a potential for physical dependence with zuranolone. These adverse reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity. The risk for developing physical dependence and a subsequent withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt ZURZUVAE discontinuation for individuals who take a higher than recommended dosage and/or use ZURZUVAE for a longer duration than recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] has not been evaluated in clinical studies. However, convulsions were observed in a dog upon abrupt zuranolone discontinuation after dogs were administered zuranolone for 14 days at doses that produced exposures higher than the maximum recommended human dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] .']","['9.1 Controlled Substance ZURZUVAE contains zuranolone, a Schedule IV controlled substance.']","['9.2 Abuse Zuranolone has abuse potential with associated risks of misuse, abuse, and substance use disorder including addiction.

Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] , reserve OLINVYK for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. The cumulative total daily dose should not exceed 27 mg, as total daily doses greater than 27 mg may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ] . OLINVYK is an opioid agonist indicated in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve OLINVYK for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]: Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. The cumulative total daily dose should not exceed 27 mg. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 5.5 ).']","[""2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous administration only. OLINVYK should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of OLINVYK for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with OLINVYK. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Initiate treatment with a 1.5 mg dose. ( 2.2 ) For patient controlled analgesia (PCA), recommended demand dose is 0.35 mg, with a 6-minute lock-out. A demand dose of 0.5 mg may be considered. ( 2.2 ) Supplemental doses of 0.75 mg can be administered, beginning 1 hour after the initial dose, and hourly thereafter, as needed. ( 2.2 ) Do not abruptly discontinue OLINVYK in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.4 , 5.14 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions For intravenous administration only. OLINVYK should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Individual single doses greater than 3 mg have not been evaluated. The cumulative daily dose should not exceed 27 mg. OLINVYK 30 mg/30 mL (1mg/mL) vial is intended for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use only. Draw OLINVYK directly from the vial into the PCA syringe or IV bag without diluting. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of OLINVYK for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Use of OLINVYK beyond 48 hours has not been studied in controlled clinical trials. There is variability in opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse ( 5.1 )] . Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with OLINVYK. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] . Inspect OLINVYK for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution is a clear, colorless, preservative free solution for intravenous use. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are observed, do not use. 2.2 Initial Dosage OLINVYK can be administered by a healthcare provider with an initial dose of 1.5 mg. For PCA, the initial dose can be followed by access to patient demand doses with a 6-minute lock-out. The recommended demand dose is 0.35 mg. A demand dose of 0.5 mg may be considered for some patients if the potential benefit outweighs the risks. Supplemental doses of 0.75 mg OLINVYK can be administered by healthcare providers, beginning 1 hour after the initial dose, and hourly thereafter as needed. Onset of analgesic effect is expected within 2 to 5 minutes after the initial dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Do not administer single doses greater than 3 mg [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The cumulative total daily dose should not exceed 27 mg. If patients reach a 27 mg cumulative daily dose and analgesia is still required, an alternative analgesic regimen should be administered until OLINVYK can be resumed the next day. Alternative analgesia may include multi-modal therapies. The safety of OLINVYK beyond 48 hours of use was not evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Conversion Between Morphine Intravenous Injection and OLINVYK Intravenous Injection Based on data collected in clinical studies, an initial 1 mg dose of OLINVYK is approximately equipotent to morphine 5 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. As individual patients differ in their response to opioid drugs, this comparison should be used only as a guide. 2.3 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of OLINVYK. Individually titrate OLINVYK to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving OLINVYK to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.14 )] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OLINVYK dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after a dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.4 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of OLINVYK When a patient who has been taking opioids regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with OLINVYK, taper the dose gradually while regularly evaluating for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue OLINVYK in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ); Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] .""]","['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection: clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free solution for intravenous use supplied as follows: 1 mg/mL, equivalent to 1.3 mg/mL oliceridine fumarate salt, in single-dose, 2 mL, clear glass vials with gray plastic flip-off caps 2 mg/2 mL (1 mg/mL), equivalent to 2.6 mg/2 mL (1.3 mg/mL) oliceridine fumarate salt, in single-dose, 2 mL, clear glass vials with orange plastic flip-off caps 30 mg/30 mL (1 mg/mL), equivalent to 39 mg/30 mL (1.3 mg/mL) oliceridine fumarate salt, in single-patient-use, 30 mL, clear glass vials with purple plastic flip-off caps.

If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation. ( 5.7 ) Potential for QT Prolongation with Daily Doses Exceeding 27 mg : May increase risk for QT interval prolongation. Do not exceed a cumulative daily dose of 27 mg. ( 5.5 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.8 ) Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement corticosteroids and wean the patient off the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension : Monitor patients during initiation or titration. Avoid use of OLINVYK in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid the use of OLINVYK in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse OLINVYK contains oliceridine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, OLINVYK exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OLINVYK. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )] . Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing OLINVYK, and monitor all patients receiving OLINVYK for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OLINVYK, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OLINVYK along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OLINVYK. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see Overdosage ( 10.2 )] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of opioids, the risk is greatest during initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially when initiating therapy with OLINVYK and following dosage increases. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of OLINVYK is essential [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Overestimating the OLINVYK dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OLINVYK with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, or alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of OLINVYK for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life‑threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.5 Potential for QT prolongation with Daily Doses exceeding 27 mg The effect of oliceridine on cardiac physiology was studied in single and multiple-dose thorough QT studies. The multiple-dose study was conducted with a maximum daily cumulative dose of 27 mg. In both studies, there was mild QTc interval prolongation. In the multiple-dose study, the maximum mean ΔΔQTcI was 11.7 ms (two-sided 90% UCI 14.7 ms) at 9 hours. The effect on QT prolongation at total cumulative daily doses >27 mg has not been studied in a thorough QT study [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Total cumulative daily doses exceeding 27 mg per day may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation. Therefore, the cumulative total daily dose of OLINVYK should not exceed 27 mg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 5.6 Risk of Use in Patients with Decreased Cytochrome P450 2D6 Function or Concomitant Use or Discontinuation with Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Risk of Increased Oliceridine Plasma Concentrations Increased plasma concentrations of oliceridine, which may result in prolonged opioid adverse reactions and exacerbated respiratory depression, may occur when OLINVYK is used under the following conditions: In patients with decreased Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 function (poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 or normal metabolizers taking moderate or strong CYP2D6 inhibitors) [See Drug Interactions ( 7 ); Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )]. In patients taking a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor In patients with decreased CYP2D6 function who are also receiving a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor Discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer These patients may require less frequent dosing of OLINVYK. Closely monitor these patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and base subsequent doses of OLINVYK on the patient’s severity of pain and response to treatment. [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 , 12.5 )]. Risk of Lower than Expected Oliceridine Plasma Concentrations Lower than expected concentrations of oliceridine, which may lead to decreased efficacy, may occur under the following conditions: Concomitant use of OLINVYK with CYP3A4 inducers Discontinuation of a moderate or strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor Closely monitor these patients at frequent intervals and consider supplemental doses of OLINVYK [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 )] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ); Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of OLINVYK in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : OLINVYK-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OLINVYK [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OLINVYK and when OLINVYK is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ); Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension OLINVYK may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OLINVYK. In patients with circulatory shock, OLINVYK may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OLINVYK in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), OLINVYK may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OLINVYK. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OLINVYK in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions OLINVYK is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. OLINVYK may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders OLINVYK may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OLINVYK therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue OLINVYK in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing OLINVYK in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of oliceridine in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OLINVYK. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery OLINVYK may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OLINVYK and know how they will react to the medication. 5.16 Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Although self-administration of opioids by PCA may allow each patient to individually titrate to an acceptable level of analgesia, PCA administration has resulted in adverse outcomes and episodes of respiratory depression. Health care providers and family members monitoring patients receiving PCA analgesia should be instructed in the need for appropriate monitoring for excessive sedation, respiratory depression, or other adverse effects of opioid medications.']","[""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Life-threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] The most common (incidence ≥10%) adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2) were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus, and hypoxia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Trevena, Inc. at 1-844-465-4686 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. A total of 1535 patients were treated with OLINVYK in controlled and open-label trials in patients with moderate to severe acute pain. Of these, 1181 patients received a total daily dose ≤27 mg and 354 patients received a total daily dose >27 mg during the first 24-hour treatment period. Among patients who received a daily dose of >27 mg, 198 patients received a daily dose between 27 mg and 40 mg, and 142 patients received a daily dose >40 mg. The most common adverse drug reactions (≥10%) in controlled efficacy trials (Study 1 and Study 2) were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus and hypoxia. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of OLINVYK were hypotension, hypoxia, nausea, hypoventilation, oxygen saturation decreased, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, electrocardiogram QT prolongation, and urticaria. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and morphine-controlled studies, when stratified by 27 mg daily dosing limit, discontinuation of OLINVYK due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients who received a daily dose ≤ 27 mg, and less than 1% of patients who received a daily dose >27 mg. In these same studies, discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of morphine-treated patients, and no placebo-treated patients. In an open-label safety study, discontinuation of OLINVYK due to adverse drug reactions occurred in 3% of patients who received a daily dose ≤ 27 mg, and 1% of patients who received a daily dose >27 mg. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and morphine-controlled studies in patients with moderate to severe acute pain following either orthopedic surgery-bunionectomy (Study 1), or plastic surgery-abdominoplasty (Study 2), patients received one of three OLINVYK dosing regimens, a morphine- control regimen, or a volume‑matched placebo-control regimen. All dosing regimens were administered via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), allowing patients to individually titrate the dose available to an acceptable level of analgesia. Patients were treated for up to 48 hours in the bunionectomy study (Study 1), and for up to 24 hours in the abdominoplasty study(Study 2) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The loading dose for all OLINVYK treatment regimens was 1.5 mg; demand doses were 0.1, 0.35, or 0.5 mg, according to assigned treatment group; supplemental doses of 0.75 mg were permitted, beginning 1 hour after the loading dose, and hourly thereafter, as needed. The loading dose for the morphine treatment regimen was 4 mg; the demand dose was 1 mg; and supplemental doses of 2 mg were permitted, beginning 1 hour after the loading dose, and hourly thereafter, as needed. A lockout interval of 6 minutes was used for all PCA regimens. In Study 1, a total of 136 patients received OLINVYK ≤27 mg/day, and 98 patients received OLINVYK >27 mg/day during the first 24 hours. In Study 2, a total of 180 patients received OLINVYK ≤27 mg/day, and 56 patients received OLINVYK >27 mg/day during the first 24 hours. Table 1 and Table 2 list adverse drug reactions that were reported in ≥5% of OLINVYK-treated patients in each study, and that occurred at a frequency greater than placebo in at least one of the studies. Table 2 and Table 3 lists adverse drug reactions that were reported in ≥5% of OLINVYK-treated patients for pooled Studies 1 and 2 stratified by total daily dose (≤27 mg/day or >27 mg/day). These data are not an adequate basis for comparison of rates between the OLINVYK treatment group and the morphine treatment group. The OLINVYK and morphine dosing regimens studied are not considered equipotent.

OLINVYK was administered via clinician-administered bolus dosing, PCA, or a combination of the two. Bolus dosing was initiated at 1 to 2 mg, with supplemental doses of 1 to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours, as needed, based on individual patient need and previous response to OLINVYK. If OLINVYK was administered via PCA, the loading dose was 1.5 mg, the demand dose was 0.5 mg, and the lockout interval was 6 minutes. Supplemental doses of 1 mg were given as needed, taking into account the patient's utilization of PCA demand doses, individual patient need, and previous response to OLINVYK. In Study 3, for the patients within the highest cumulative dose group (exposure >36 mg), the mean cumulative exposure was 67 mg (range: 37 mg to 224 mg) and the mean cumulative duration of exposure was 54 hours (range: 6 hours to 143 hours). The mean cumulative dose of OLINVYK administered to patients in the Study 3 was 30 mg over a mean cumulative duration of 29 hours. The most frequent condition treated in Study 3 was post-surgical acute pain, and included (in order of decreasing frequency): orthopedic, gynecologic, colorectal, general, plastic, urologic, neurologic (including spinal), bariatric, and cardiothoracic surgical procedures. In Study 3, of the 768 patients treated with OLINVYK, 32% were age 65 years or older and 78% had a Body Mass Index ≥25 kg/m 2 . OLINVYK was administered as needed; 55% of patients received OLINVYK via clinician bolus administration only, and 45% of patients received OLINVYK via PCA self-administration or a combination of clinician bolus- and PCA self-administration. In Study 3 (open-label), a total of 592 patients received OLINVYK ≤27 mg/day and 176 received OLINVYK >27 mg during the first 24 hours. Adverse drug reactions reported in ≥5% of patients receiving OLINVYK in Study 3, stratified by total daily dose (≤27 mg/day or >27 mg/day), are presented in Table 4.

drug interactions with OLINVYK. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with OLINVYK Moderate to Strong Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of a moderate to strong CYP2D6 inhibitor can increase the plasma concentration of oliceridine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. Intervention: If concomitant use is necessary, patients taking a moderate to strong CYP2D6 inhibitor may require less frequent dosing of OLINVYK. Monitor closely for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and base subsequent doses on the patient’s severity of pain and response to treatment. If a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, increase of the OLINVYK dosage may be considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. Examples: Paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion Moderate to Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Clinical Impact: The concomitant administration of moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of oliceridine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid adverse reactions. After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the oliceridine concentration may decrease, resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to oliceridine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . Intervention: Caution should be used when administering OLINVYK to patients taking inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme. If concomitant use is necessary, patients taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor may require less frequent dosing. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, increase of the OLINVYK dosage may be considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. Examples: Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP2D6 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: OLINVYK is primarily metabolized by both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Compared to inhibition of either metabolic pathway, inhibition of both pathways can result in a greater increase of the plasma concentrations of oliceridine and prolong opioid adverse reactions [See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Intervention: Patients who are CYP2D6 normal metabolizers taking a CYP2D6 inhibitor, and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) may require less frequent dosing. Patients who are known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) may require less frequent dosing. These patients should be closely monitored for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals, and subsequent doses should be based on the patient’s severity of pain and response to treatment. Examples: Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), anti-retroviral agents, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), NS3/4A inhibitors. Inhibitors of CYP2D6: Paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion Inducers of CYP3A4 Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of OLINVYK and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of oliceridine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to oliceridine. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] . After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oliceridine plasma concentration may increase [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression. Intervention: If concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducer is necessary, increase of the OLINVYK dosage may be considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider OLINVYK dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression. Examples: Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue OLINVYK if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,) serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of OLINVYK and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: OLINVYK may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of OLINVYK and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OLINVYK is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Moderate and Strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Patients may require less frequent dosing. Monitor closely and administer subsequent doses based on severity of pain and patient response. ( 5.6 , 7 ) Serotonergic Drugs : Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue OLINVYK if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ( 7 ) Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics : Avoid use with OLINVYK because they may reduce analgesic effect of OLINVYK or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. ( 7 )']","['8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) Decreased CYP2D6 function: Patients may require less frequent dosing. Monitor closely and administer subsequent doses based on severity of pain and patient response. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . There are no available data on OLINVYK use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. There are adverse outcomes reported within detal exposure to opioid analgesics (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproductive studies, oliceridine reduced live litter size at birth and increased postnatal pup mortality between birth and Postnatal Day 4 when administered intravenously to rats from organogenesis through weaning at doses producing clinically relevant plasma exposure. Oliceridine had no effect on embryo-fetal development in rats and rabbits when administered intravenously during organogenesis at doses producing plasma exposures 7 and 8 times the estimated plasma exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an AUC basis, respectively (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, should be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate. OLINVYK is not recommended for use in pregnant women during and immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics can prolong labor through actions that temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to OLINVYK during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Data Animal Data Oliceridine administered via continuous intravenous infusion during the period of embryofetal organogenesis at doses of 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats from Gestation Day (GD) 6 to 20 and 1.5, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits from GD 7 to 29 had no effect on embryonic development at exposures 7 (rats) to 8 times (rabbits) the estimated plasma exposure at the MRHD of 27 mg/day on an AUC basis. Maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain) was observed at ≥12 mg/kg/day in rats and at 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits. In a pre−and post−natal development study in rats, oliceridine administered via continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 0.6, 2.4, and 6.0 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 6 through Lactation Day 21 resulted in reduced live litter size at birth at 1.5 times the estimated plasma exposure at the MRHD on an AUC basis and lower pup survival between birth and Postnatal Day 4 at 0.6 times the estimated plasma exposure at the MRHD on an AUC basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether oliceridine is present in human milk. The effects of oliceridine on a breastfeeding infant and on milk production have not been evaluated. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for OLINVYK and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OLINVYK or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor infants exposed to OLINVYK through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped or when breastfeeding is stopped. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Human Data Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Animal Data Oliceridine administered intravenously for 14 days prior to cohabitation and administered through GD15 caused prolonged estrous cycle lengths and decreased the number of implantations and viable embryos in female rats at doses producing plasma exposures ≥ 3 times the MRHD on an AUC basis [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of OLINVYK in pediatric patients has not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Controlled clinical studies of OLINVYK did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to OLINVYK. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of OLINVYK slowly in geriatric patients and monitor for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with end-stage renal disease, there was no clinically significant change in oliceridine clearance. Therefore, dosage adjustment of OLINVYK in patients with renal impairment is not required [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, no adjustment of the initial dose is needed; however, these patients may require less frequent dosing. When using OLINVYK in patients with severe hepatic impairment, consider reducing the initial dose, and administer subsequent doses only after a careful review of the patient’s severity of pain and overall clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.8 Poor Metabolizers of CYP2D6 Substrates In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2D6 substrates, less frequent dosing of OLINVYK may be required. These patients should be closely monitored, and subsequent doses should be based on the patient’s severity of pain and response to treatment.

Titrate the dosage of OLINVYK slowly in geriatric patients and monitor for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] .']","['11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in OLINVYK is oliceridine, an opioid agonist. Oliceridine fumarate is a white to lightly-colored solid that is sparingly soluble in water. The chemical name for oliceridine fumarate is [(3-methoxythiophen-2-yl)methyl]({2-[(9R)-9-(pyridin-2-yl)-6-oxaspiro[4.5]decan-9-yl]ethyl})amine fumarate, and the molecular formula is C 22 H 30 N 2 O 2 S·C 4 H 4 O 4 . The theoretical average molecular mass is 502.62 (fumarate salt) and 386.55 (free base). The structural formula of oliceridine fumarate is: OLINVYK (oliceridine) injection is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free solution, pH 6.4 to 7.4, in a glass vial for intravenous use. Each milliliter of the solution contains 1.0 mg of oliceridine free base (1.3 mg of oliceridine fumarate salt), as well as L-histidine and mannitol, in water for injection. Structural Formula']","['12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Oliceridine is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor. The principal therapeutic action of oliceridine is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oliceridine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory, and CNS depression. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In nonclinical models, the antinociceptive effect of oliceridine can be antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone. Effects on the Central Nervous System Opioids produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Opioids causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Opioids causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects on the Cardiovascular System Opioids produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive. Concentration-Analgesia Relationships In a fixed-dose bunionectomy trial (N=192), the onset of action of OLINVYK (as measured by the two-stopwatch method) was almost immediate (median 1-3 minutes) upon administration of the first dose. Perceptible pain relief was achieved in the majority of patients within 5 minutes after the first dose of OLINVYK. The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oliceridine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 )] . Concentration-Adverse Experience Relationships There is a general relationship between increasing oliceridine doses and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 )] . Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of oliceridine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 2 dedicated Thorough QT/QTc studies. A single-dose, randomized, positive- (moxifloxacin) and placebo-controlled 4 period crossover study evaluated the ECG effects of oliceridine at a therapeutic (3 mg IV infusion) and a supratherapeutic (6 mg IV infusion) dose in 62 healthy volunteers. Dose-dependent QTc prolongation (3 mg: 7 ms [upper 90% CI: 9 ms]; 6 mg: 12 ms [14 ms]), which occurred after peak oliceridine plasma concentration, was observed in this study. A multi-dose, randomized, positive- (moxifloxacin) and placebo-controlled 3-way crossover study in 65 healthy volunteers evaluated intermittent dosing over 24 hours to the maximum daily cumulative dose of 27 mg. The maximum mean ΔΔQTcI was 11.7 ms (two-sided 90% UCI 14.7 ms) at 9 hours. Thereafter, the QTc effect did not progressively increase with repeat dosing, and despite continued dosing began to diminish after 12 hours. The underlying mechanism and clinical significance of the transient QT changes seen in the single-dose and multiple-dose studies in healthy volunteers are unknown. These findings should be carefully considered when OLINVYK is administered in clinical settings where prolongation of the QT interval has been observed either due to the use of concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval or to underlying medical conditions associated with QT interval prolongation. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution The mean steady-state volume of distribution of oliceridine ranges between 90-120 L indicating extensive tissue distribution. The plasma protein binding of oliceridine is 77%. In vitro data indicate that oliceridine is not an inhibitor of any of the major transporters, including breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and MDR1, at clinically relevant concentrations. Elimination Metabolism In vitro studies suggest that oliceridine is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 P450 hepatic enzymes, with minor contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 into inactive metabolites. The mean clearance of oliceridine decreases slightly with increasing dose, resulting in greater-than-proportional exposure, particularly at doses greater than 2 mg. The percent of unchanged oliceridine excreted in the urine is low (0.97-6.75% of dose), reflecting its low renal clearance. The pharmacokinetics of oliceridine were not changed substantially (except for peak concentrations) when administered over different infusion times. Excretion Metabolic clearance is the major route of elimination of oliceridine, primarily by oxidation with subsequent glucuronidation. Additional biotransformation pathways included N −dealkylation, glucuronidation, and dehydrogenation. The majority of the metabolites (approximately 70%) are eliminated in the urine, with the remainder eliminated in the feces. Only a small amount of unchanged drug (0.97-6.75% of a dose) is found in the urine. The half-life of these metabolites (~44 hours) is much longer than that of unchanged oliceridine (1.3-3 hours). In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that none of these metabolites has any appreciable activity at the mu-opioid receptor. Specific Populations Renal Impairment In a study comparing subjects with end stage renal disease (N=8) to healthy age and sex−matched healthy subjects (N=8), no significant difference in oliceridine clearance was observed. OLINVYK doses do not need to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment In a study of mild (N=8), moderate (N=8), or severe hepatic impairment (N=6), both clearance and total exposure were similar to age and sex-matched healthy controls (N=8). The mean half-life of oliceridine was increased in subjects with moderate (4.3 hours) or severe (5.8 hours) hepatic impairment, as compared with healthy subjects (2.1 hours), or patients with mild hepatic impairment (2.6 hours). The estimated volume of distribution of oliceridine was significantly higher in subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (212 and 348 L, respectively), as compared to healthy subjects (126 L) or patients with mild hepatic impairment (167 L). Based on these data, the initial dose of OLINVYK does not need to be reduced in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, but these patients may require less frequent dosing. Use caution when dosing OLINVYK in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Consider reducing the initial dose, and administer subsequent doses only after a careful review of the patient’s severity of pain and overall clinical status. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies suggest that oliceridine is metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 P450 hepatic enzymes, with minor contributions from CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Inhibition studies using selective inhibitors of all the major CYP enzymes show that only the inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 significantly affects the metabolism of oliceridine in these assays, suggesting that the contribution of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to the metabolism of oliceridine is minor. The effect of concomitant administration of a CYP2D6 inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of OLINVYK, although not studied, may be similar to that noted in subjects who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The plasma clearance of oliceridine in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is approximately 50% of plasma clearance in subjects who are nonpoor CYP2D6 metabolizers [See Pharmacogenomics ( 12.5 )]. In healthy subjects CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (n=4) given a single 0.25 mg dose of OLINVYK after 5 days of itraconazole 200 mg QD (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), the total exposure (AUC) of OLINVYK was increased by approximately 80%; however, the peak concentration was not significantly affected [See Pharmacogenomics ( 12.5 )] . The mean clearance of oliceridine was reduced to approximately 30% of that observed in nonpoor metabolizers of CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Oliceridine does not inhibit any P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics Oliceridine is metabolized by polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have little to no enzyme activity. Approximately 3 to 10% of Whites, 2 to 7% of African Americans, and <2% of Asians, generally lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers . In healthy subjects who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, the AUC 0−inf of oliceridine was approximately 2-fold higher than in subjects who are nonpoor CYP2D6 metabolizers.

In each study, pain intensity was measured using a patient-reported numeric rating scale (11-point numerical scale ranging from 0-10, where zero corresponds to no pain and 10 corresponds to worst pain imaginable). In each study, patients were randomized to one of three OLINVYK treatment regimens, a placebo-control regimen, or a morphine-control regimen. Each blinded treatment regimen consisted of a loading dose, incremental doses delivered as needed via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device, and supplemental doses, beginning 1 hour after the initial dose, and hourly thereafter, as needed. The loading dose for all OLINVYK treatment regimens was 1.5 mg; demand doses were 0.1, 0.35 or 0.5 mg, according to the assigned treatment group; supplemental doses were 0.75 mg. The loading dose for the morphine treatment regimen was 4 mg; the demand dose was 1 mg; supplemental doses were 2 mg. The placebo-control regimen was volume-matched. A lockout interval of 6 minutes was used for all PCA regimens. For Studies 1 and 2, patients may have received rescue pain medication (pre-defined in the protocols as etodolac 200 mg every 6 hours, as needed) if the patient requested rescue pain medication and reported a Numeric Rating Scale score ≥4. 14.1 Study 1 – Orthopedic Surgery - Bunionectomy A total of 389 patients (placebo n=79, OLINVYK 0.1 mg n=76, OLINVYK 0.35 mg n=79, OLINVYK 0.5 mg n=79, and morphine n=76), 19-74 years of age, with moderate to severe acute pain following orthopedic surgery-bunionectomy, were treated for up to 48 hours in Study 1 (NCT02815709). Treatment began after discontinuation of regional anesthesia in patients with pain intensity of ≥4 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale [NRS] within 9 hours after discontinuation of regional anesthesia. The analgesic effects were measured using the Summed Pain Intensity Differences over 48 hours (SPID-48). The SPID-48 is calculated by multiplying the Pain Intensity Difference (calculated by subtracting the pain intensity at a particular timepoint from the pain intensity at baseline) scores at each post-baseline timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the preceding timepoint, and then summing the values, over 48 hours. The majority of the study population was female (85%), and the mean age was 45 years. Patients were 69% White, 24% Black or African American, 4% Asian, 1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 1% American Indian or Alaska Native and 1% other races. Twenty-five (25%) of patients were Hispanic or Latino. The majority of patients treated with OLINVYK (0.1 mg treatment group: 83%; 0.35 mg treatment group 87%; 0.5 mg treatment group 84%) completed the randomized treatment period (compared to 60% of patients treated with placebo). Nine percent (9%), 4%, and 5% of patients in the 0.1 mg, 0.35 mg and 0.5 mg OLINVYK treatment groups, respectively, discontinued study medication due to lack of efficacy (compared to 34% of patients treated with placebo). In the 0.1 mg, 0.35 mg and 0.5 mg OLINVYK treatment groups, 41%, 20%, and 17% of patients, respectively, used the protocol-specified rescue medication etodolac, compared to 77% of patients treated with placebo.

Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of OLINVYK increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of OLINVYK with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction. All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of OLINVYK abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing oliceridine, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use OLINVYK in combination with other abused drugs. “Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control. OLINVYK, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs. Risk Specific to Abuse of OLINVYK Abuse of OLINVYK injection poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of OLINVYK with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. 9.3 Dependence Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use. OLINVYK should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. If OLINVYK is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, typically characterized by restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] .']","['9.1 Controlled Substance OLINVYK contains oliceridine, a Schedule II controlled substance.']","['9.2 Abuse OLINVYK contains oliceridine, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . 10.2 Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. The opioid antagonist, naloxone, is a specific antidote for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. While naloxone reversal of OLINVYK’s effects has not been established in humans, some pharmacological effects (analgesia) of oliceridine have been shown to be reversed by naloxone in animals [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oliceridine overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of oliceridine in OLINVYK injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.']",[],[],"['0371308011105', '0371308021104']"

Maximum recommended dosage is 3 mg once daily. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Adjunctive Therapy to Antidepressants for the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder The starting dosage of VRAYLAR is 1.5 mg once daily. Depending upon clinical response and tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 3 mg once daily on Day 15. In clinical trials, dosage titration at intervals of less than 14 days resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Maximum recommended dosage is 3 mg once daily. 2. 6 Dosage Adjustments for CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Dosage recommendation for patients initiating a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor while on a stable dose of VRAYLAR : If a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is initiated, reduce the current dosage of VRAYLAR by half. For patients taking 4.5 mg daily, the dosage should be reduced to 1.5 mg or 3 mg daily. For patients taking 1.5 mg daily, the dosing regimen should be adjusted to every other day. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn, VRAYLAR dosage may need to be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Dosage recommendation for patients initiating VRAYLAR therapy while already on a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor: Patients should be administered 1.5 mg of VRAYLAR on Day 1 and on Day 3 with no dose administered on Day 2. From Day 4 onward, the dose should be administered at 1.5 mg daily, then increased to a maximum dose of 3 mg daily. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn, VRAYLAR dosage may need to be increased [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Dosage recommendation for patients concomitantly taking VRAYLAR with CYP3A4 i nducers: Concomitant use of VRAYLAR and a CYP3A4 inducer has not been evaluated and is not recommended because the net effect on active drug and metabolites is unclear [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 2. 7 Treatment Discontinuation Following discontinuation of VRAYLAR, the decline in plasma concentrations of active drug and metabolites may not be immediately reflected in patients’ clinical symptoms; the plasma concentration of cariprazine and its active metabolites will decline by 50% in ~1 week [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from VRAYLAR to other antipsychotics or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics.']",['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS VRAYLAR (cariprazine) capsules are available in four strengths. 6 mg capsules: Purple cap and white body imprinted with “FL 6” Capsules: 6 mg ( 3 )'],"['4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VRAYLAR is contraindicated in patients with history of a hypersensitivity reaction to cariprazine. Reactions have ranged from rash, pruritus, urticaria, and reactions suggestive of angioedema (e.g., swollen tongue, lip swelling, face edema, pharyngeal edema, and swelling face). Known hypersensitivity to VRAYLAR ( 4 )']","['5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) ( 5.3 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring ( 5.4 ) Tardive Dyskinesia : Discontinue if appropriate ( 5.5 ) Late-Occurring Adverse Reactions: Because of VRAYLAR’s long half-life, monitor for adverse reactions and patient response for several weeks after starting VRAYLAR and with each dosage change ( 5.6 ) Metabolic Changes : Monitor for hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and weight gain ( 5.7 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis : Perform complete blood counts (CBC) in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell counts (WBC) or history of leukopenia or neutropenia. Consider discontinuing VRAYLAR if a clinically significant decline in WBC occurs in absence of other causative factors ( 5.8 ) Orthostatic H ypotension and Syncope : Monitor heart rate and blood pressure and warn patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and risk of dehydration or syncope ( 5.9 ) Seizures: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold ( 5.11 ) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Use caution when operating machinery ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Antipsychotic drugs increase the all-cause risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Analyses of 17 dementia-related psychosis placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks and largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs) revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times that in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in placebo-treated patients. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] . 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric* and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18-24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 years old 1 fewer patient ≥65 years old 6 fewer patients * VRAYLAR is not approved for use in pediatric patients. It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing VRAYLAR, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5. 3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke , in Elderly Patients with Dementia -Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 5. 4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue VRAYLAR and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5. 5 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including VRAYLAR. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Given these considerations, VRAYLAR should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on VRAYLAR, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with VRAYLAR despite the presence of the syndrome. 5. 6 Late - Occurring Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions may first appear several weeks after the initiation of VRAYLAR treatment, probably because plasma levels of cariprazine and its major metabolites accumulate over time. As a result, the incidence of adverse reactions in short-term trials may not reflect the rates after longer term exposures [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Monitor for adverse reactions, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) or akathisia, and patient response for several weeks after a patient has begun VRAYLAR and after each dosage increase. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. 5. 7 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including VRAYLAR, have caused metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with VRAYLAR. Although all drugs in the class to date have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assess fasting plasma glucose before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication and monitor periodically during long-term treatment. Schizophrenia In the 6-week, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, the proportion of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) and borderline (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with VRAYLAR and placebo. In the long-term, open-label schizophrenia studies, 4% patients with normal hemoglobin A1c baseline values developed elevated levels (≥ 6.5%). Bipolar Disorder In six placebo-controlled trials up to 8-weeks of adult patients with bipolar disorder (mania or depression), the proportion of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) and borderline (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with VRAYLAR and placebo. In the long-term, open-label bipolar disorder studies, 4% patients with normal hemoglobin A1c baseline values developed elevated levels (≥ 6.5%). Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder In two 6-week placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with major depressive disorder, the proportion of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) was greatest in the VRAYLAR 3 mg per day + antidepressant therapy arm (3.2%) compared with those taking VRAYLAR 1.5 mg per day + antidepressant therapy (2%) or those placebo-treated (1.3%). The proportion of patients with shifts from normal to borderline (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) or from borderline to high were similar in patients treated with VRAYLAR and placebo. In a long-term, open-label adjunctive treatment of MDD study, 7% patients with normal hemoglobin A1c baseline values developed elevated levels (> 6%). In one 8-week placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with major depressive disorder, the changes from baseline to end of the trial in fasting glucose were similar among the VRAYLAR and placebo + antidepressant therapy treatment groups. During the 8-week trial, serum insulin levels increased by 12 pmol/L in the VRAYLAR 1 mg to 2 mg per day group, 20 pmol/L in the VRAYLAR 2 mg to 4.5 mg per day group, and 8.5 pmol/L in the placebo group. Dyslipidemia Atypical antipsychotics cause adverse alterations in lipids. Before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication, obtain a fasting lipid profile at baseline and monitor periodically during treatment. Schizophrenia In the 6-week, placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, the proportion of patients with shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were similar in patients treated with VRAYLAR and placebo. Bipolar Disorder In six placebo-controlled trials up to 8-weeks of adult patients with bipolar disorder (mania or depression), the proportion of patients with shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were similar in patients treated with VRAYLAR and placebo. Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder In two 6-week placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with major depressive disorder, the proportion of patients with shifts in total cholesterol, fasting LDL, HDL, and fasting triglycerides were similar in patients treated with VRAYLAR and placebo. Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed with use of atypical antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter. Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 show the change in body weight occurring from baseline to endpoint in 6-week trials of schizophrenia, 3-week bipolar mania trials, 6-week and 8-week bipolar depression trials, and 6-week and 8-week trials of adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, respectively.

VRAYLAR was associated with mean change from baseline in weight of 1.7 kg at Week 26. In the long-term, open-label adjunctive treatment of MDD trial, 19% of patients demonstrated a ≥7% increase in body weight, and 5% demonstrated a ≥7% decrease in body weight. 5. 8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents, including VRAYLAR. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class. Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of VRAYLAR at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue VRAYLAR in patients with absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 and follow their WBC until recovery. 5. 9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension was infrequent in trials of VRAYLAR and was not more frequent on VRAYLAR than placebo. Syncope was not observed. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g., elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease. Such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials. 5. 10 Falls Antipsychotics, including VRAYLAR, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5. 11 Seizures Like other antipsychotic drugs, VRAYLAR may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in older patients. 5. 12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment VRAYLAR, like other antipsychotics, may cause somnolence and has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. In 6-week schizophrenia trials, somnolence (hypersomnia, sedation, and somnolence) was reported in 7% of VRAYLAR-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. In 3-week bipolar mania trials, somnolence was reported in 8% of VRAYLAR-treated patients compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. In two 6-week and one 8-week trials of depressive episodes of bipolar I disorder, VRAYLAR-treated patients reported 7% somnolence and 4% in the placebo-treated patients. In 6-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials, somnolence was reported in 6% of VRAYLAR-treated patients compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. In one 8-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trial, somnolence was reported in 11% of VRAYLAR-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with VRAYLAR does not affect them adversely. 5. 13 Body Temperature Dysr egulation Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature. Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use VRAYLAR with caution in patient who may experience these conditions. 5. 14 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Dysphagia has been reported with VRAYLAR. VRAYLAR and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration.']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Late Occurring Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Metabolic Changes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Falls [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Body Temperature Dysregulation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Dysphagia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were ( 6.1 ): Schizophrenia: extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia Bipolar mania: extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, dyspepsia, vomiting, somnolence, and restlessness Bipolar depression: nausea, akathisia, restlessness, and extrapyramidal symptoms Adjunctive treatment of MDD: akathisia, restlessness, fatigue, constipation, nausea, insomnia, increased appetite, dizziness, and extrapyramidal symptoms To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The information below is derived from an integrated clinical study database for VRAYLAR consisting of 6,722 adult patients exposed to one or more doses of VRAYLAR for the treatment of schizophrenia, manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, bipolar depression, and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder in placebo-controlled studies. This experience corresponds with a total experience of 1,182.8 patient-years. A total of 4,329 VRAYLAR-treated patients had at least 6 weeks and 296 VRAYLAR-treated patients had at least 48 weeks of exposure. Patients with Schizophrenia The following findings are based on four placebo-controlled, 6-week schizophrenia trials with VRAYLAR doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 6 mg daily. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment: There was no single adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at a rate of ≥ 2% in VRAYLAR-treated patients and at least twice the rate of placebo. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) : extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia.

Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment : The adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at a rate of ≥ 2% in VRAYLAR-treated patients and at least twice the rate of placebo was akathisia (2%). Overall, 6% of the patients who received VRAYLAR discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 3% of placebo-treated patients in these trials. Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) : Akathisia, nausea, and insomnia occurred in two 6-week, fixed-dose trials. Akathisia, restlessness, fatigue, constipation, nausea, increased appetite, dizziness, insomnia, and extrapyramidal symptoms occurred in one 8-week flexible-dose trial. Adverse Reactions with an incidence of ≥ 2% and greater than placebo at 1.5 mg or 3 mg doses are shown in Table 9 . Table 9.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. Although these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) and Akathisia In schizophrenia, bipolar mania, bipolar depression, and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials, data were objectively collected using the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) for treatment-emergent EPS (parkinsonism) (SAS total score ≤ 3 at baseline and > 3 post-baseline) and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for treatment-emergent akathisia (BARS total score ≤ 2 at baseline and > 2 post-baseline). In 6-week schizophrenia trials, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), excluding akathisia and restlessness was 17% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 8% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 0.3% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia was 11% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 0.5% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. In 3-week bipolar mania trials, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 28% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 12% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to a discontinuation in 1% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia was 20% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 5% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 2% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients. In the two 6-week and one 8-week bipolar depression trials, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to EPS, excluding akathisia and restlessness was 4% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 2% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 0.4% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia was 8% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 2% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 1.5% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients. In the two 6-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to EPS, excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 6% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 0.3% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.6% of placebo-treated patients. The combined incidence of akathisia and restlessness was 12% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 2% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. In one 8-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trial, the incidence of reported adverse reactions related to EPS, excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 12% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 5% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 1% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia and restlessness was 22% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 6% for placebo-treated patients. These reactions led to discontinuation in 3% of VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.0% of placebo-treated patients. Cataracts The development of cataracts was observed in nonclinical studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 ) ] . Cataracts were reported during the premarketing clinical trials of cariprazine; however, the duration of trials was too short to assess any association to cariprazine usage. Vital Signs Changes There were no clinically meaningful differences between VRAYLAR-treated patients and placebo-treated patients in mean change from baseline to endpoint in supine blood pressure parameters except for an increase in supine diastolic blood pressure in the 9 - 12 mg/day VRAYLAR-treated patients with schizophrenia. Pooled data from 6-week schizophrenia trials are shown in Table 11, and from 3-week bipolar mania trials are shown in Table 12. Table 11. Mean Change in Blood Pressure at Endpoint in 6-Week Schizophrenia Trials Placebo (N=574) VRAYLAR* 1.5 - 3 mg/day (N=512) 4.5 - 6 mg/day (N=570) 9 - 12 mg/day ⸰ (N=203) Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) +0.9 +0.6 +1.3 +2.1 Supine Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) +0.4 +0.2 +1.6 +3.4 * Data shown by modal daily dose, defined as most frequently administered dose per patient ⸰ The maximum recommended daily dose is 6 mg. Doses above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions. Table 12. Mean Change in Blood Pressure at Endpoint in 3-Week Bipolar Mania Trials Placebo (N=439) VRAYLAR* 3 - 6 mg/day (N=259) 9 – 12 mg/day ⸰ (N=360) Supine Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) -0.5 +0.8 +1.8 Supine Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) +0.9 +1.5 +1.9 * Data shown by modal daily dose, defined as most frequently administered dose per patient ⸰ The maximum recommended daily dose is 6 mg. Doses above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions. In the two 6-week and one 8-week bipolar depression trials, there were no clinically meaningful differences between VRAYLAR-treated patients and placebo-treated patients in mean change from baseline to endpoint in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. VRAYLAR-treated patients’ supine blood pressure increased by 0.1 to 0.3 mmHg; placebo-treated patients’ supine blood pressure increased by 0.2 mmHg. In two 6-week and one 8-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials, there were no clinically meaningful differences between VRAYLAR-treated patients and placebo-treated patients in mean change from baseline to endpoint in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. At the end of the 6-week trials, VRAYLAR-treated patients’ supine systolic blood pressure decreased by 0.1 to 0.7 mmHg; placebo-treated patients’ supine systolic blood pressure decreased by 0.1 mmHg. VRAYLAR-treated patients’ supine diastolic blood pressure increased by 0.1 mmHg and placebo-treated patients’ supine diastolic blood pressure increased by 0.2 mmHg. Changes in Laboratory Tests The proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of ≥3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in 6-week schizophrenia trials ranged between 1% and 2% for VRAYLAR-treated patients, increasing with dose, and was 1% for placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of ≥3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in 3-week bipolar mania trials ranged between 2% and 4% for VRAYLAR-treated patients depending on dose group administered and 2% for placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of ≥3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in 6-week and 8-week bipolar depression trials ranged between 0% and 0.5% for VRAYLAR-treated patients depending on dose group administered and 0.4% for placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of ≥3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in two 6-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials ranged between 0% and 1% for VRAYLAR-treated patients depending on dose group administered and 0% for placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) greater than 1000 U/L in 6-week schizophrenia trials ranged between 4% and 6% for VRAYLAR-treated patients, increasing with dose, and was 4% for placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with elevations of CPK greater than 1000 U/L in 3-week bipolar mania trials was about 4% in VRAYLAR and placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with elevations of CPK greater than 1000 U/L in 6-week and 8-week bipolar depression trials ranged between 0.2% and 1% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0.2% for placebo-treated patients. The proportions of patients with elevations of CPK greater than 1000 U/L in two 6-week adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder trials ranged between 0.6% and 0.8% for VRAYLAR-treated patients versus 0% for placebo-treated patients. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Pre - marketing Evaluation of VRAYLAR Adverse reactions listed below were reported by patients treated with VRAYLAR at doses of ≥ 1.5 mg once daily within the premarketing database of 5,763 VRAYLAR-treated patients. The reactions listed are those that could be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pharmacologic or other grounds. Reactions that appear elsewhere in the VRAYLAR label are not included. Reactions are further categorized by organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency, according to the following definition: those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (frequent) [only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing]; those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients (rare). Gastrointestinal D isorders: Infrequent : gastroesop hageal reflux disease, gastritis Hepatobiliary D isorders: Rare: hepatitis Metabolism and N utrition D isorders: Frequent : decreased appetite; Rare : hyponatremia Musculoskeletal and C onnective T issue D isorders: Rare : rhabdomyolysis Nervous S ystem D isorders: Rare : ischemic stroke Psychiatric D isorders: Infrequent: suicide ideation; Rare : completed suicide , suicide attempts Renal and U rinary D isorders: Infrequent : pollakiuria Skin and S ubcutaneous T issue D isorders: Infrequent: hyperhidrosis 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post approval use of VRAYLAR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to VRAYLAR during pregnancy. For more information, contact the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visit http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). There are no available data on VRAYLAR use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks for birth defects or miscarriage. The major active metabolite of cariprazine, DDCAR, has been detected in adult patients up to 12 weeks after discontinuation of VRAYLAR [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Based on animal data, VRAYLAR may cause fetal harm. Administration of cariprazine to rats during the period of organogenesis caused malformations, lower pup survival, and developmental delays at drug exposures less than the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day. However, cariprazine was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 4.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates whose mothers were exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Data Animal Data Administration of cariprazine to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 0.5, 2.5, and 7.5 mg/kg/day, which are 0.2 to 3.5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine (i.e. sum of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR), caused fetal developmental toxicity at all doses, which included reduced body weight, decreased male anogenital distance, and skeletal malformations of bent limb bones, scapula, and humerus. These effects occurred in the absence or presence of maternal toxicity. Maternal toxicity, observed as a reduction in body weight and food consumption, occurred at doses 1.2 and 3.5-times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. At these doses, cariprazine caused fetal external malformations (localized fetal thoracic edema), visceral variations (undeveloped/underdeveloped renal papillae and/or distended urethrae), and skeletal developmental variations (bent ribs, unossified sternebrae). Cariprazine had no effect on fetal survival. Administration of cariprazine to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation at oral doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg/day, which are 0.03 to 0.4 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine, caused a decrease in postnatal survival, birth weight, and post-weaning body weight of first generation pups at the dose that is 0.4 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine in absence of maternal toxicity. First generation pups also had pale, cold bodies and developmental delays (renal papillae not developed or underdeveloped and decreased auditory startle response in males). Reproductive performance of the first generation pups was unaffected; however, the second generation pups had clinical signs and lower body weight similar to those of the first generation pups. Administration of cariprazine to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of 0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day, which are 0.02 to 4.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine, was not teratogenic. Maternal body weight and food consumption were decreased at 4.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine; however, no adverse effects were observed on pregnancy parameters or reproductive organs. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of cariprazine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cariprazine is present in rat milk. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for VRAYLAR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from VRAYLAR or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric studies of VRAYLAR have not been conducted. Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of VRAYLAR did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. VRAYLAR is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warning s and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 ) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment for VRAYLAR is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 5 and 9) [ see C linical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Usage of VRAYLAR is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 10 and 15). VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in this patient population. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment for VRAYLAR is required in patients with mild to moderate (CrCL ≥ 30 mL/minute) renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Usage of VRAYLAR is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/minute). VRAYLAR has not been evaluated in this patient population. 8.8 Smoking No dosage adjustment for VRAYLAR is needed for patients who smoke. VRAYLAR is not a substrate for CYP1A2; smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of VRAYLAR. 8.9 Other Specific Populations No dosage adjustment is required based on patient’s age, sex, or race. These factors do not affect the pharmacokinetics of VRAYLAR [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] .']","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to VRAYLAR during pregnancy.

However, the efficacy of cariprazine could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at central dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors. Cariprazine forms two major metabolites, desmethylcariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethylcariprazine (DDCAR), that have in vitro receptor binding profiles similar to the parent drug. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cariprazine acts as a partial agonist at the dopamine D 3 and D 2 receptors with high binding affinity (K i values 0.085 nM, and 0.49 nM (D 2L ) and 0.69 nM (D 2S ), respectively) and at the serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors (K i value 2.6 nM). Cariprazine acts as an antagonist at 5-HT 2 B and 5-HT 2A receptors with high and moderate binding affinity (Ki values 0.58 nM and 18.8 nM respectively) as well as it binds to the histamine H 1 receptors (K i value 23.2 nM). Cariprazine shows lower binding affinity to the serotonin 5-HT 2C and α 1 A - adrenergic receptors (K i values 134 nM and 155 nM, respectively) and has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC 50 >1000 nM). Effect on QTc Interval At a dose three-times the maximum recommended dose, cariprazine does not prolong the QTc interval to clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics VRAYLAR activity is thought to be mediated by cariprazine and its two major active metabolites, desmethylcariprazine (DCAR) and didesmethylcariprazine (DDCAR), which are pharmacologically equipotent to cariprazine. After multiple dose administration of VRAYLAR, mean cariprazine and DCAR concentrations reached steady state at around Week 1 to Week 2 and mean DDCAR concentrations appeared to be approaching steady state at around Week 4 to Week 8 in a 12-week study (Figure 1). The half-lives based on time to reach steady state, estimated from the mean concentration-time curves, are 2 to 4 days for cariprazine, about 1 to 2 days for DCAR, and approximately 1 to 3 weeks for DDCAR. The time to reach steady state for the major active metabolite DDCAR was variable across patients, with some patients not achieving steady state at the end of the 12 week treatment [ s ee Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] . Mean concentrations of DCAR and DDCAR are approximately 30% and 400%, respectively, of cariprazine concentrations by the end of 12-week treatment. After discontinuation of VRAYLAR, cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR plasma concentrations declined in a multi-exponential manner. Mean plasma concentrations of DDCAR decreased by about 50% 1 week after the last dose, and mean cariprazine and DCAR concentration dropped by about 50% in about 1 day. There was an approximately 90% decline in plasma exposure within 1 week for cariprazine and DCAR, and at about 4 weeks for DDCAR. Following a single dose of 1 mg of cariprazine administration, DDCAR remained detectable 8 weeks post-dose. After multiple dosing of VRAYLAR, plasma exposure of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR increases approximately proportionally over the therapeutic dose range. Figure 1 . Plasma Concentration (Mean ± SE) -Time Profile During and Following 12-weeks of Treatment with Cariprazine 6 mg/day a a Trough concentrations shown during treatment with cariprazine 6 mg/day. SE: standard error; TOTAL CAR: sum concentration of cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR; CAR: cariprazine Absorption After single dose administration of VRAYLAR, the peak plasma cariprazine concentration occurred in approximately 3-6 hours. Administration of a single dose of 1.5 mg VRAYLAR capsule with a high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C max and AUC of cariprazine or DCAR. Distribution Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are highly bound (91 to 97%) to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Cariprazine is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6 to DCAR and DDCAR. DCAR is further metabolized into DDCAR by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. DDCAR is then metabolized by CYP3A4 to a hydroxylated metabolite. Excretion Following administration of 12.5 mg/day cariprazine to patients with schizophrenia for 27 days, about 21% of the daily dose was found in urine, with approximately 1.2% of the daily dose excreted in urine as unchanged cariprazine. Studies in Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Compared to healthy subjects, exposure (C max and AUC) in patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 5 and 9) was approximately 25% higher for cariprazine and 20% to 30% lower for the major metabolites (DCAR and DDCAR) following daily doses of 0.5 mg cariprazine for 14 days [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are minimally excreted in urine. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no significant relationship between plasma clearance and creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status does not have clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, DCAR, or DDCAR. Age , Sex, Race Age, sex, or race does not have clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, DCAR, or DDCAR. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies Cariprazine and its major active metabolites did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzymes and were weak inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Cariprazine was also a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2A6, and CYP2E1 in vitro. Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), or the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Cariprazine and its major active metabolites were poor or non-inhibitors of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), and organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3) in vitro . The major active metabolites were also poor or non-inhibitors of transporter P-gp although cariprazine was probably a P-gp inhibitor based on the theoretical GI concentrations at high doses in vitro . Based on in vitro studies, VRAYLAR is unlikely to cause clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions with substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, and CYP3A4, or OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3. In vivo studies CYP3A4 inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with VRAYLAR (0.5 mg/day) increased cariprazine C max and AUC 0-24h by about 3.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively; increased DDCAR C max and AUC 0-24h by about 1.5-fold; and decreased DCAR C max and AUC 0-24h by about one-third. The impact of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors has not been studied. CYP3A4 inducers CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation and elimination of the active metabolites of cariprazine. The effect of CYP3A4 inducers on the plasma exposure of cariprazine and its major active metabolites has not been evaluated, and the net effect is unclear. CYP2D6 inhibitors CYP2D6 inhibitors are not expected to influence pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, DCAR, or DDCAR based on the observations in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Proton pump inhibitors Co-administration of pantoprazole (40 mg/day), a proton pump inhibitor, with VRAYLAR (6 mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia for 15 days did not affect cariprazine exposure at steady-state, based on C max and AUC 0-24 . Similarly, no significant change in exposure to DCAR and DDCAR was observed. Figure 1.

Following a single dose of 1 mg of cariprazine administration, DDCAR remained detectable 8 weeks post-dose. After multiple dosing of VRAYLAR, plasma exposure of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR increases approximately proportionally over the therapeutic dose range. Figure 1 . Plasma Concentration (Mean ± SE) -Time Profile During and Following 12-weeks of Treatment with Cariprazine 6 mg/day a a Trough concentrations shown during treatment with cariprazine 6 mg/day. SE: standard error; TOTAL CAR: sum concentration of cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR; CAR: cariprazine Absorption After single dose administration of VRAYLAR, the peak plasma cariprazine concentration occurred in approximately 3-6 hours. Administration of a single dose of 1.5 mg VRAYLAR capsule with a high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C max and AUC of cariprazine or DCAR. Distribution Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are highly bound (91 to 97%) to plasma proteins. Elimination Metabolism Cariprazine is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2D6 to DCAR and DDCAR. DCAR is further metabolized into DDCAR by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. DDCAR is then metabolized by CYP3A4 to a hydroxylated metabolite. Excretion Following administration of 12.5 mg/day cariprazine to patients with schizophrenia for 27 days, about 21% of the daily dose was found in urine, with approximately 1.2% of the daily dose excreted in urine as unchanged cariprazine. Studies in Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Compared to healthy subjects, exposure (C max and AUC) in patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score between 5 and 9) was approximately 25% higher for cariprazine and 20% to 30% lower for the major metabolites (DCAR and DDCAR) following daily doses of 0.5 mg cariprazine for 14 days [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Impairment Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are minimally excreted in urine. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated no significant relationship between plasma clearance and creatinine clearance [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status does not have clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, DCAR, or DDCAR. Age , Sex, Race Age, sex, or race does not have clinically relevant effect on pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, DCAR, or DDCAR. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies Cariprazine and its major active metabolites did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzymes and were weak inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Cariprazine was also a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2A6, and CYP2E1 in vitro. Cariprazine and its major active metabolites are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), or the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Cariprazine and its major active metabolites were poor or non-inhibitors of transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), and organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3) in vitro . The major active metabolites were also poor or non-inhibitors of transporter P-gp although cariprazine was probably a P-gp inhibitor based on the theoretical GI concentrations at high doses in vitro . Based on in vitro studies, VRAYLAR is unlikely to cause clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions with substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, and CYP3A4, or OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3. In vivo studies CYP3A4 inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg/day), a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with VRAYLAR (0.5 mg/day) increased cariprazine C max and AUC 0-24h by about 3.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively; increased DDCAR C max and AUC 0-24h by about 1.5-fold; and decreased DCAR C max and AUC 0-24h by about one-third. The impact of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors has not been studied. CYP3A4 inducers CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation and elimination of the active metabolites of cariprazine. The effect of CYP3A4 inducers on the plasma exposure of cariprazine and its major active metabolites has not been evaluated, and the net effect is unclear. CYP2D6 inhibitors CYP2D6 inhibitors are not expected to influence pharmacokinetics of cariprazine, DCAR, or DDCAR based on the observations in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Proton pump inhibitors Co-administration of pantoprazole (40 mg/day), a proton pump inhibitor, with VRAYLAR (6 mg/day) in patients with schizophrenia for 15 days did not affect cariprazine exposure at steady-state, based on C max and AUC 0-24 . Similarly, no significant change in exposure to DCAR and DDCAR was observed. Figure 1.

Rats were administered cariprazine at oral doses of 0.25, 0.75, and 2.5 (males)/1, 2.5, and 7.5 mg/kg/day (females) which are 0.2 to 1.8 (males)/ 0.8 to 4.1 (females) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. Tg.rasH2 mice were administered cariprazine at oral doses of 1, 5, and 15 (males)/5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day (females) which are 0.2 to 7.9 (males)/2.6 to 19 (females) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. Mutagenesis Cariprazine was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, nor clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. However, cariprazine increased the mutation frequency in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay under conditions of metabolic activation. The major human metabolite DDCAR was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, however, it was clastogenic and induced structural chromosomal aberration in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay. Impairment of Fertility Cariprazine was administered orally to male and female rats before mating, through mating, and up to day 7 of gestation at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day which are 1.6 to 16 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on mg/m 2 . In female rats, lower fertility and conception indices were observed at all dose levels which are equal to or higher than 1.6 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on mg/m 2 . No effects on male fertility were noted at any dose up to 4.3 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Cariprazine caused bilateral cataract and cystic degeneration of the retina in the dog following oral daily administration for 13 weeks and/or 1 year and retinal degeneration/atrophy in the rat following oral daily administration for 2 years. Cataract in the dog was observed at 4 mg/kg/day which is 7.1 (male) and 7.7 (female) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. The NOEL for cataract and retinal toxicity in the dog is 2 mg/kg/day which is 5 (males) to 3.6 (females) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. Increased incidence and severity of retinal degeneration/atrophy in the rat occurred at all doses tested, including the low dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day, at total cariprazine plasma levels less than clinical exposure (AUC) at the MRHD of 6 mg/day. Cataract was not observed in other repeat dose studies in pigmented mice or albino rats. Phospholipidosis was observed in the lungs of rats, dogs, and mice (with or without inflammation) and in the adrenal gland cortex of dogs at clinically relevant exposures (AUC) of total cariprazine. Phospholipidosis was not reversible at the end of the 1-2 month drug-free periods. Inflammation was observed in the lungs of dogs dosed daily for 1 year with a NOEL of 1 mg/kg/day which is 2.7 (males) and 1.7 (females) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. No inflammation was observed at the end of 2-month drug free period following administration of 2 mg/kg/day which is 5 (males) and 3.6 (females) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine; however, inflammation was still present at higher doses. Hypertrophy of the adrenal gland cortex was observed at clinically relevant total cariprazine plasma concentrations in rats (females only) and mice following daily oral administration of cariprazine for 2 years and 6 months, respectively. Reversible hypertrophy/hyperplasia and vacuolation/vesiculation of the adrenal gland cortex were observed following daily oral administration of cariprazine to dogs for 1 year. The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day which is 5 (males) and 3.6 (females) times the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine. The relevance of these findings to human risk is unknown.']","['13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis There was no increase in the incidence of tumors following daily oral administration of cariprazine to rats for 2 years and to Tg.rasH2 mice for 6 months at doses which are up to 4 and 19 times respectively, the MRHD of 6 mg/day based on AUC of total cariprazine, (i.e. sum of AUC values of cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR).

An active control arm (risperidone or aripiprazole) was included in two trials to assess assay sensitivity. In all three trials, VRAYLAR was superior to placebo. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) rating scales were used as the primary and secondary efficacy measures, respectively, for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in each trial: PANSS is a 30-item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The PANSS total score may range from 30 to 210 with the higher score reflecting greater severity. The CGI-S is a validated clinician-related scale that measures the patient’s current illness state and overall clinical state on a 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7-point (extremely ill) scale. In each study, the primary endpoint was change from baseline in PANSS total score at the end of week 6. The change from baseline for VRAYLAR and active control groups was compared to placebo. The results of the trials are shown in Table 14. The time course of efficacy results of Study 2 is shown in Figure 2. Study 1: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 711) involving three fixed doses of VRAYLAR (1.5, 3, or 4.5 mg/day) and an active control (risperidone), all VRAYLAR doses and the active control were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score and the CGI-S. Study 2: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 604) involving two fixed doses of VRAYLAR (3 or 6 mg/day) and an active control (aripiprazole), both VRAYLAR doses and the active control were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score and the CGI-S. Study 3: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 439) involving two flexible-dose range groups of VRAYLAR (3 to 6 mg/day or 6 to 9 mg/day), both VRAYLAR groups were superior to placebo on the PANSS total score and the CGI-S. The efficacy of VRAYLAR was demonstrated at doses ranging from 1.5 to 9 mg/day compared to placebo. There was, however, a dose-related increase in certain adverse reactions, particularly above 6 mg. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose is 6 mg/day. Examination of population subgroups based on age (there were few patients over 55), sex, and race did not suggest any clear evidence of differential responsiveness. Table 14.

Doses above 6 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions. Figure 2 . Change from Baseline in PANSS total score by w eekly visits (Study 2) The safety and efficacy of VRAYLAR as maintenance treatment in adults with schizophrenia were demonstrated in a randomized withdrawal trial that included 200 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were clinically stable following 20 weeks of open-label cariprazine at doses of 3 to 9 mg/day. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or cariprazine at the same dose for up to 72 weeks for observation of relapse. The primary endpoint was time to relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase (DBP) was defined as meeting any one of the following criteria: hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia, increase in the PANSS total score by ≥ 30%, increase in CGI-S score by ≥ 2 points, deliberate self-injury, aggressive or violent behavior, clinically significant suicidal or homicidal ideation, or score >4 on one or more of the following PANSS items: delusions (P1), conceptual disorganization (P2), hallucination (P3), suspiciousness or persecution (P6), hostility (P7), uncooperativeness (G8), or poor impulse control (G14). The efficacy of VRAYLAR was demonstrated at doses ranging from 3 to 9 mg/day compared to placebo. There was, however, a dose-related increase in certain adverse reactions, particularly above 6 mg. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose is 6 mg/day. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to relapse during the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal phase of the long-term trial are shown in Figure 3. Time to relapse was statistically significantly longer in the VRAYLAR-treated group compared to the placebo group. Figure 3 .

In all three trials, VRAYLAR was superior to placebo. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale (CGI-S) were used as the primary and secondary efficacy measures, respectively, for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in each trial: The YMRS is an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology. YMRS total score may range from 0 to 60 with a higher score reflecting greater severity. The CGI-S is validated clinician-related scale that measures the patient’s current illness state and overall clinical state on a 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7-point (extremely ill) scale. In each study, the primary endpoint was decrease from baseline in YMRS total score at the end of week 3. The change from baseline for each VRAYLAR dose group was compared to placebo. The results of the trials are shown in Table 15. The time course of efficacy results is shown in Figure 4. Study 4: In a 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 492) involving two flexible-dose range groups of VRAYLAR (3 to 6 mg/day or 6 to 12 mg/day), both VRAYLAR dose groups were superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-S. The 6 to 12 mg/day dose group showed no additional advantage. Study 5: In a 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 235) involving a flexible-dose range of VRAYLAR (3 to 12 mg/day), VRAYLAR was superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-S. Study 6: In a 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 310) involving a flexible-dose range of VRAYLAR (3 to 12 mg/day), VRAYLAR was superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-S. The efficacy of VRAYLAR was established at doses ranging from 3 to 12 mg/day. Doses above 6 mg did not appear to have additional benefit over lower doses (Table 15), and there was a dose-related increase in certain adverse reactions. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose is 6 mg/day. Examination of population subgroups based on age (there were few patients over 55), sex, and race did not suggest any clear evidence of differential responsiveness. Table 15.

In each study, the primary endpoint was change from baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at the end of Week 6. The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated scale with total scores ranging from 0 (no depressive features) to 60 (maximum score). The MADRS total score change from baseline for VRAYLAR compared to placebo is shown in Table 16. The time course of efficacy results of Study 8 is shown in Figure 5. In each study, the VRAYLAR 1.5 mg dose demonstrated statistical significance over placebo. The secondary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 6 in CGI-S. The CGI-S is validated clinician-related scale that measures the patient’s current illness state and overall clinical state on a 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7-point (extremely ill) scale. Study 7: In an 8-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 571) involving three-fixed doses of VRAYLAR (0.75 mg/day, 1.5 mg/day, and 3 mg/day), VRAYLAR 1.5 mg was superior to placebo at end of Week 6 on the MADRS total score and the CGI-S. Study 8: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 474) involving two-fixed doses of VRAYLAR (1.5 mg/day and 3 mg/day), VRAYLAR 1.5 mg and 3 mg were superior to placebo at end of Week 6 on the MADRS total score. Study 9: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 478) involving two-fixed doses of VRAYLAR (1.5 mg/day and 3 mg/day), VRAYLAR 1.5 mg was superior to placebo at end of Week 6 on the MADRS total score and the CGI-S. Examination of population subgroups based on age (there were few patients over 55), sex, and race did not suggest any clear evidence of differential responsiveness. Table 1 6 .

Inadequate response during antidepressant treatment was defined as less than 50% improvement to antidepressant treatment of adequate dose and adequate duration. In each study, the primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 6 (Study 10) or Week 8 (Study 11) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology, with 0 representing no symptoms and 60 representing worst symptoms. Study 10: In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 751) involving two fixed doses of VRAYLAR (1.5 mg per day or 3 mg per day) + ADT, VRAYLAR 1.5 mg + ADT was superior to placebo + ADT at end of Week 6 on the MADRS total score. The treatment effect in the VRAYLAR 3 mg per day + ADT group (vs. placebo + ADT) was not statistically significant. Study 11: An 8-week, placebo-controlled trial (N = 808) involved flexible doses of VRAYLAR 1 to 2 mg per day + ADT or 2 to 4.5 mg per day + ADT. VRAYLAR 2 to 4.5 mg (mean dose was 2.6 mg) + ADT was superior to placebo + ADT at end of Week 8 on the MADRS total score. The treatment effect in the VRAYLAR 1 to 2 mg per day + ADT group (vs. placebo + ADT) was not statistically significant.

( 5.3 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. ( 5.4 ) Tardive Dyskinesia: Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate. ( 5.5 ) Metabolic Changes: Monitor for hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. ( 5.6 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis : Perform complete blood counts (CBC) in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or history of leukopenia or neutropenia. Consider discontinuing CAPLYTA if clinically significant decline in WBC occurs in absence of other causative factors. ( 5.7 ) Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Monitor heart rate and blood pressure and warn patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and risk of dehydration or syncope. ( 5.8 ) Seizures: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizure or with conditions that lower seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Use caution when operating machinery. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times that in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in placebo-treated patients. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. CAPLYTA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric* and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18-24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 years old 1 fewer patient > 65 years old 6 fewer patients * CAPLYTA is not approved for use in pediatric patients. It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing CAPLYTA, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials in elderly subjects with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. CAPLYTA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue CAPLYTA and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Given these considerations, CAPLYTA should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on CAPLYTA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with CAPLYTA despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.6 Metabolic Changes Antipsychotic drugs have caused metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Although all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with CAPLYTA. Assess fasting plasma glucose before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication and monitor periodically during long-term treatment. Schizophrenia In pooled data from short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with shifts from normal to greater than normal levels of fasting glucose in patients treated with CAPLYTA were similar to those in patients treated with placebo. In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 1 year in patients with stable schizophrenia, the percentages of patients with shifts in fasting glucose and insulin values from normal to high were 8% and 12%, respectively. 4.7% of patients with normal hemoglobin A1c (<6.5%) at baseline developed elevated levels (≥6.5%) post-baseline. Bipolar Depression In data from short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trials, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with shifts from normal to greater than normal levels of fasting glucose and insulin in patients treated with CAPLYTA were similar to those in patients treated with placebo. Dyslipidemia Antipsychotics have caused adverse alterations in lipids. Before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medications, obtain a fasting lipid profile at baseline and monitor periodically during treatment. Schizophrenia In pooled data from short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with shifts to higher levels of fasting total cholesterol and triglycerides were similar in patients treated with CAPLYTA and placebo. In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 1 year in patients with stable schizophrenia, the percentages of patients with a shift from normal to high were 8%, 5%, and 4% for total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, respectively. Bipolar Depression In data from short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trials, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with shifts to higher levels of fasting total cholesterol and triglycerides were similar in patients treated with CAPLYTA and placebo. In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 6 months in patients with bipolar depression, the proportion of patients with a shift from normal to high were 10%, 5%, and 2% for total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, respectively. Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed with use of antipsychotics. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter. Schizophrenia In pooled data from placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with an increase in weight ≥7% from baseline to end of study was similar in patients treated with CAPLYTA and placebo. In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 1 year in patients with stable schizophrenia, the mean change in body weight was approximately -2 kg (SD 5.6) at Day 175 and approximately - 3.2 kg (SD 7.4) at Day 350. Bipolar Depression In data from short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trials, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with an increase in weight ≥7% from baseline to end of study were similar in patients treated with CAPLYTA and placebo. In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 6 months in patients with bipolar depression, the mean change in body weight was -0.01 kg (SD 3.1) at Day 175. 5.7 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents, including CAPLYTA. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class. Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of CAPLYTA at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue CAPLYTA in patients with absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 and follow their WBC until recovery. 5.8 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose administration. Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g., elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, and concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications), patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. CAPLYTA has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease. Such patients were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials. Schizophrenia In pooled data from short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials, the frequencies of orthostatic hypotension for CAPLYTA and placebo were 0.7% and 0%, respectively. The rates of syncope for CAPLYTA and placebo were 0.2% and 0.2%. Bipolar Depression In data from short-term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trials, the frequencies of orthostatic hypotension for CAPLYTA and placebo were both 0%. The rates of syncope for CAPLYTA and placebo were 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively in the monotherapy trials, and there were no reports for CAPLYTA or placebo in the adjunctive therapy trial. 5.9 Falls Antipsychotics, including CAPLYTA, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures and other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and periodically during long-term treatment. 5.10 Seizures Like other antipsychotic drugs, CAPLYTA may cause seizures. The risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in older patients. 5.11 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment CAPLYTA, like other antipsychotics, may cause somnolence and has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with CAPLYTA does not affect them adversely. Schizophrenia In short-term (i.e., 4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled clinical trials of patients with schizophrenia, somnolence and sedation were reported in 24% of CAPLYTA-treated patients, compared to 10% of placebo-treated patients. Bipolar Depression In short term (6-week), placebo-controlled monotherapy and adjunctive therapy bipolar depression clinical trials, somnolence and sedation were reported in 13% of CAPLYTA-treated patients, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. 5.12 Body Temperature Dysregulation Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature. Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use CAPLYTA with caution in patients who may experience these conditions. 5.13 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Antipsychotic drugs, including CAPLYTA, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration.']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Metabolic Changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Falls [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Body Temperature Dysregulation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Dysphagia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Most common adverse reactions in clinical trials (incidence > 5% and greater than twice placebo) were ( 6.1 ): Schizophrenia: somnolence/sedation and dry mouth.

The safety of CAPLYTA has been evaluated in placebo-controlled clinical trials in 2664 adult patients with schizophrenia and bipolar depression exposed to one or more doses. A total of 402 CAPLYTA-exposed patients had at least 6 months of exposure and 108 had at least 1 year of exposure to the 42-mg dose of CAPLYTA. Schizophrenia The following findings are based on the pooled short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled studies in adult patients with schizophrenia in which CAPLYTA was administered at a daily dose of 42 mg (N=406). There was no single adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at a rate of >2% in CAPLYTA-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5% of patients exposed to CAPLYTA and greater than twice the rate of placebo) are somnolence/sedation and dry mouth. Adverse reactions associated with CAPLYTA (incidence of at least 2% in patients exposed to CAPLYTA and greater than placebo) are shown in Table 2.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. Although these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) In the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar depression studies, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) for EPS (total score ranges from 0 to 40), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia (total score ranges from 0 to 14) and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia (total score ranges from 0 to 28). Schizophrenia In the 4- to 6-week, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials, the frequency of reported events related to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, muscle spasms, restlessness, musculoskeletal stiffness, dyskinesia, dystonia, muscle twitching, tardive dyskinesia, tremor, drooling, and involuntary muscle contractions was 6.7% for CAPLYTA and 6.3% for placebo. In the 4- to 6-week schizophrenia trials, the mean changes from baseline for CAPLYTA-treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1 and 0 for the SAS, -0.1 and 0 for the BARS, and 0.1 and 0 for the AIMS, respectively. Bipolar Depression In the 6-week, monotherapy bipolar depression trials, the frequency of reported reactions related to EPS, including muscle spasms, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder, tremor, restlessness, and akathisia was 1.3% for CAPLYTA and 1.1% for placebo. In a 6-week, adjunctive therapy bipolar depression trial, the frequency of reported reactions related to EPS, including tremor, muscle spasms, akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, gait disturbance, and restlessness was 4.0% for CAPLYTA and 2.3% for placebo. In the 6-week, monotherapy bipolar depression trials, the mean changes from baseline for CAPLYTA-treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0 and 0 for the SAS, -0.1 and -0.1 for the BARS, and 0 and 0 for the AIMS, respectively.

( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including CAPLYTA, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or online at http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/ . Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Available data from case reports on CAPLYTA use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish any drug associated risks for birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including CAPLYTA, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, no malformations were observed with oral administration of lumateperone to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 9.7 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 42 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. When pregnant rats were administered lumateperone during the period of organogenesis through lactation, the number of perinatal deaths of pups was increased at 4.9 times the MRHD, with no adverse effects on pups at 2.4 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk There is risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia is associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3.5, 10.5, 21, and 63 mg/kg/day lumateperone (0.8, 2.4, 4.9, and 14.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) during the period of organogenesis. No malformations were observed with lumateperone at doses up to 2.4 times the MRHD. Findings of decreased body weight were observed in fetuses at 4.9 and 14.6 times the MRHD. Findings of incomplete ossification and increased incidences of visceral and skeletal variations were recorded in fetuses at 14.6 times the MRHD, a dose that induced maternal toxicity. Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 2.1, 7, and 21 mg/kg/day lumateperone (1.0, 3.2, and 9.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) during the period of organogenesis. Lumateperone did not cause adverse developmental effects at doses up to 9.7 times the MRHD. In a study in which pregnant rats were administered oral doses of 3.5, 10.5, and 21 mg/kg/day lumateperone (0.8, 2.4, and 4.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) during the period of organogenesis and through lactation, the number of live-born pups was decreased at 2.4 and 4.9 times the MRHD, and early postnatal deaths increased at a dose 4.9 times the MRHD. Impaired nursing and decreased body weight gain in pups were observed at 4.9 times, but not at 2.4 times, the MRHD. Pregnant rats were treated with a human metabolite of lumateperone (reduced ketone metabolite) at oral doses of 15, 60, and 100 mg/kg/day (1.2, 19, and 27 times the exposure to this metabolite at the MRHD of lumateperone based on AUC plasma exposure) during the period of organogenesis. This metabolite did not cause adverse developmental effects at a dose 1.2 times the exposure at the MRHD of lumateperone; however, it caused an increase in visceral malformations (cleft palate) at 27 times and skeletal malformations at 19 times the exposure at the MRHD of lumateperone, a dose that induced maternal toxicity. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Lumateperone and its metabolites are present in human breast milk in low amounts. In a clinical lactation study, lumateperone was detected in human milk at an estimated daily infant dose 0.0004 mg/kg, with a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.06% the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Several major circulating metabolites were similarly detected in breast milk in low amounts; however, aniline metabolites were not present in milk or maternal plasma at quantifiable levels (see Data) . There are no data on the effects of lumateperone on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for CAPLYTA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CAPLYTA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data A lactation study in 17 lactating women evaluated the concentrations of lumateperone and its metabolites in plasma and mature breast milk following a single dose of 42 mg CAPLYTA. The estimated daily infant dose of lumateperone in human milk was 0.0004 mg/kg/day (with assumed average milk consumption of 200 ml/kg/day). The mean relative infant dose (RID) (with assumed mean milk consumption of 200 mL/kg/day and average maternal weight of 71 kg) was 0.06% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Several major circulating metabolites were also present in breast milk at estimated daily infant dose of 0.0004 mg/kg/day. Aniline metabolites were not present in milk or maternal plasma at quantifiable levels. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Based on findings from animal studies, lumateperone may impair male and female fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of CAPLYTA have not been established in pediatric patients. Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Controlled clinical studies of CAPLYTA in the treatment of schizophrenia did not include any patients aged 65 or older to determine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients. Controlled clinical studies of CAPLYTA in the treatment of bipolar depression included patients aged 65 or older; the number of patients was not sufficient to determine whether or not they respond differently from younger patients. Antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. CAPLYTA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and (5.3 ) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment generally had higher exposure to lumateperone than patients with normal hepatic function; therefore, a dosage reduction of CAPLYTA is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A).']","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including CAPLYTA, during pregnancy.

Chemical Structure""]","[""12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of lumateperone in the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder is unknown. However, the efficacy of lumateperone could be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at central serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors and postsynaptic antagonist activity at central dopamine D 2 receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Lumateperone has high binding affinity for serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors (K i = 0.54 nM) and moderate binding affinity for dopamine D 2 (K i = 32 nM) receptors. Lumateperone has moderate binding affinity for serotonin transporters (K i = 33 nM). Lumateperone also has moderate binding affinity for dopamine D 1 (41 nM) and D 4 and adrenergic alpha 1A and alpha 1B receptors (K i projected at < 100 nM) but has low binding affinity (less than 50% inhibition at 100 nM) for muscarinic and histaminergic receptors. Cardiac Electrophysiology QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active- (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled, four-arm crossover study utilizing concentration-QTc effect modeling in 33 patients with schizophrenia. The placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF (90% two-sided upper confidence interval) values of 4.9 (8.9) and 15.8 (19.8) ms for the 42 mg and the supratherapeutic dose of 126 mg (three times the recommended daily dosage) CAPLYTA, respectively, administered orally once daily for 5 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following once daily oral administration of CAPLYTA, lumateperone steady state is reached in about 5 days. Lumateperone steady-state exposure is approximately dose-proportional in the range of 3.5 mg to 56 mg (0.08 to 1.3 times the approved recommended daily dosage). A large inter-subject variability in lumateperone PK parameters was observed, with coefficients of variation for C max (peak plasma concentration) and AUC (area under the concentration vs time curve) ranging from 68% to 97% at steady state. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of lumateperone capsules is about 4.4%. C max of lumateperone is reached approximately 1-2 hours after CAPLYTA dosing. Effect of Food Ingestion of a high-fat meal with CAPLYTA lowers lumateperone mean C max by 33% and increases mean AUC by 9%. Median T max was delayed about 1 hour (from 1 hour at fasted state to 2 hours in the presence of food). Distribution Protein binding of lumateperone is 97.4% at 5 µM (about 70-fold higher than therapeutic concentrations) in human plasma. The volume of distribution of lumateperone following intravenous administration is about 4.1 L/kg. Elimination The clearance of lumateperone is approximately 27.9 L/hour and the terminal half-life is about 18 hours after intravenous administration. Metabolism Lumateperone is extensively metabolized with more than twenty metabolites identified in vivo . After a single 14 C-labeled oral dose, lumateperone and glucuronidated metabolites represent about 2.8% and 51% of the total plasma radioactivity, respectively. In vitro studies show that multiple enzymes, including but not limited to uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, UGT) 1A1, 1A4, and 2B15, aldoketoreductase (AKR)1C1, 1B10, and 1C4, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C8, and 1A2, are involved in the metabolism of lumateperone. Excretion In a human mass‑balance study, 58% and 29% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as unchanged lumateperone in the urine. Specific Populations Effects of hepatic or renal impairment on lumateperone exposure are presented in Figure 1. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lumateperone were observed based on age, sex, or race.

Male and female CD-1 mice were administered lumateperone at oral doses of 3.5, 10.5 or 21 mg/kg/day for the first 35 days, then doses were reduced to 1.4, 4.9, and 14 mg/kg/day, respectively, for the duration of the study. In this study, the no adverse effect level for neoplastic lesions was determined to be 10.5/4.9 mg/kg/day (15 mg/m 2 /day) for each sex which is 0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Mutagenesis No evidence of mutagenic potential was found in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and the mouse lymphoma test without metabolic activation. Lumateperone was positive in the Ames test only in the presence of metabolic activation and only in the TA1537 strain and was positive in the mouse lymphoma test only in the presence of metabolic activation and only at high concentrations that inhibited cell growth; together these results were thought to be related to solubility limits and/or nonspecific effects on cellular function. Lumateperone was negative for clastogenic activity in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats and was not genotoxic in the in vivo Comet assay in rats. Impairment of Fertility Female rats were treated with oral doses of 3.5, 10.5, 21 or 42 mg/kg/day lumateperone (free base) (0.8, 2.4, 4.9, and 9.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) prior to mating and continuing through conception and implantation. Estrus cycle irregularities were observed at doses ≥10.5 mg/kg/day. Decreases in the median number of corpora lutea and implantation sites, and increases in the number of non-gravid uteruses, were recorded at 42 mg/kg/day. Decreased gestation body weight and body weight gain, and increases in time to mating, were observed at 21 and 42 mg/kg/day. Male rats were treated with oral doses of 3.5, 10.5, 21 or 42 mg/kg/day lumateperone (0.8, 2.4, 4.9, and 9.7 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) for 9 weeks prior to mating and throughout 14 days of mating. Decreased sperm motility, changes in sperm morphology, reduced epididymal counts, and adverse histopathology changes in testes and epididymides were observed at 21 and 42 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Oral administration of lumateperone caused systemic intracytoplasmic accumulation of pigmented material in dogs, rats, and mice at clinically relevant exposures (AUC). Intracytoplasmic pigmentation appeared to be localized in lysosomes. Accumulation of pigmented material persisted without reversal at the end of 1- to 2-month drug-free periods. Pigmented material was observed in the brain and spinal cord of all three species, and in the heart and eye of rats. Although the composition of the pigmented material was not established, the material is likely polymers or protein adducts formed from aniline metabolites of lumateperone. In the dog, accumulation of pigmented material in the brain and spinal cord was associated with neuronal degeneration and necrosis, followed by axonal degeneration and histiocytic inflammation after oral administration of lumateperone for up to 9 months. In the rat, accumulation of pigmented material was associated with degenerative changes and signs of an inflammatory response in the spinal cord, peripheral nervous system, eye, and heart after oral administration of lumateperone for up to 2 years. Although overt degenerative changes were not observed in the rat brain, the presence of pigment-containing infiltrating macrophages is consistent with an inflammatory response. The role of intracytoplasmic pigmented material in causing these lesions was not definitively established; however, the colocalization of pigmented material in tissues with degenerative changes and signs of inflammation is supportive. Alternatively, the aniline metabolites of lumateperone may undergo metabolic activation forming reactive metabolites that contribute to the observed toxicities. The role of intracellular accumulation of lumateperone or its non-aniline metabolites in these toxicities could not be ruled out. The aniline metabolites thought to be responsible for these toxicities were detected in dogs and rats but were not present in humans at quantifiable levels. Based on all the available evidence, these toxicities do not appear to be relevant to humans.']","['13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rats and mice, and results showed no carcinogenic potential in either species. In Sprague-Dawley rats, males were administered lumateperone (free base) at oral doses of 3.5, 7 or 14 mg/kg/day and females were administered lumateperone at oral doses of 3.5, 10.5, or 21 mg/kg/day for the first 385 days, then doses were reduced for the two higher dose groups so that the females were administered 3.5, 7 or 14 mg/kg/day, respectively, for the duration of the study.

Study 1 (NCT01499563) was a four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in adult patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 4. The PANSS is a 30-item scale used to measure symptoms of schizophrenia. Each item is rated by a clinician on a seven-point scale. A score of 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and a score of 7 indicates extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS total score may range from 30 to 210 with higher scores reflecting greater overall symptom severity. A total of 335 patients were randomized to receive CAPLYTA 42 mg, CAPLYTA 84 mg (two times the recommended daily dose), an active comparator, or placebo. The study was not designed to allow for efficacy comparison of CAPLYTA and the active comparator. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar for the CAPLYTA, active comparator, and placebo groups. Median age was 42 years (range 20 to 55 years). 17% were female, 19% were Caucasian, and 78% were African American. Compared to the placebo group, patients randomized to CAPLYTA 42 mg showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline to Day 28 in the PANSS total score. The treatment effect in the CAPLYTA 84 mg group (vs. placebo) was not statistically significant. The results of Study 1 are shown in Table 6. Study 2 (NCT02282761) was a four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in adult patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM-5 criteria. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the PANSS total score at Week 4. A total of 450 patients were randomized to receive CAPLYTA 28 mg (two-thirds the recommended daily dose), CAPLYTA 42 mg, or placebo. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar for the CAPLYTA and placebo groups. Median age was 44 years (range 19 to 60 years); 23% were female, 26% were Caucasian and 66% were African American. Compared to the placebo group, patients randomized to CAPLYTA 42 mg showed a statistically significant reduction from baseline to Day 28 in the PANSS total score. The treatment effect in the CAPLYTA 28 mg group (vs. placebo) was not statistically significant. The results of Study 2 are shown in Table 6. Studies 1 and 2 did not include any patients aged 65 or older. Examination of subgroups by sex and race did not suggest differences in response in either study.

Figure 3: Change from Baseline in PANSS Total Score by Time (Weeks) in Patients with Schizophrenia in Study 2. 14.2 Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I or II Disorder (Bipolar Depression) Monotherapy The efficacy of CAPLYTA, as monotherapy, was established in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in adult patients who met DSM-5 criteria for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (Study 3; NCT03249376). The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 6. The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated scale with total scores ranging from 0 (no depressive features) to 60 (maximum score). The secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-BP-S) total score at Week 6. The CGI-BP-S total score is a clinician-rated scale that measures the patient’s current illness state on a 21-point scale that assesses depression, mania, and overall illness, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. A total of 381 patients were randomized to receive CAPLYTA 42 mg or placebo. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for the CAPLYTA and placebo groups. Median age was 45 (range 18 to 72). 58% were female, 91% were Caucasian, and 8% were African-American. Compared to the placebo group, patients randomized to CAPLYTA 42 mg showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline to Day 43 in the MADRS total score and CGI-BP-S total score. The results of Study 3 are shown in Table 7. Examination of subgroups by age, sex, and race did not suggest differences in response in the study. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate The efficacy of CAPLYTA, as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, was established in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in adult patients who met DSM-5 criteria for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (Study 4; NCT02600507). The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 6. The secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in CGI-BP-S depression score at Week 6. The CGI-BP-S depression score is a clinician-rated scale that measures the patient’s current illness state on a 7-point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. A total of 529 patients were randomized to receive CAPLYTA 28 mg (two-thirds the recommended daily dose), CAPLYTA 42 mg, or placebo. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for the CAPLYTA and placebo groups. Median age was 46 (range 18 to 74). 58% were female, 88% were Caucasian, and 11% were African-American. Compared to the placebo group, patients randomized to CAPLYTA 42 mg showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline to Day 43 in the MADRS total score and CGI-BP-S depression score. The treatment effect in the CAPLYTA 28 mg group (vs. placebo) was not statistically significant. The results of Study 4 are shown in Table 7. Examination of subgroups by age, sex, and race did not suggest differences in response in the study.

CAPLYTA may cause serious side effects, including : Increased risk of death in elderly people with dementia related psychosis. Medicines like CAPLYTA can raise the risk of death in elderly people who have lost touch with reality (psychosis) due to confusion and memory loss (dementia). CAPLYTA is not approved for the treatment of people with dementia-related psychosis. Increased risk of suicidal thoughts and actions. CAPLYTA and antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts and actions in some children, adolescents, and young adults especially within the first few months of treatment or when the dose is changed . Depression and other mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when CAPLYTA or the antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed.

Safety and effectiveness of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets have not been established (1) as initial monotherapy; (2) for conversion to monotherapy from AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate; or (3) for simultaneous conversion to monotherapy from 2 or more concomitant AEDs. 1.2 Bipolar Disorder Lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Limitations of Use Treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes is not recommended. Effectiveness of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in the acute treatment of mood episodes has not been established.']","['2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosing is based on concomitant medications, indication, and patient age. (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4) To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations should not be exceeded. Lamotrigine Starter Kits and Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Patient Titration Kits are available for the first 5 weeks of treatment. (2.1, 16) Do not restart lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in patients who discontinued due to rash unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. (2.1, 5.1) Adjustments to maintenance doses will be necessary in most patients starting or stopping estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. (2.1, 5.8) Discontinuation: Taper over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% dose reduction per week). (2.1, 5.9) Epilepsy: Adjunctive therapy—See Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Tables 2 and 3 for patients aged 2 to 12 years. (2.2) Conversion to monotherapy—See Table 4. (2.3) Bipolar disorder: See Tables 5 and 6. (2.4) 2.1 General Dosing Considerations Rash There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of lamotrigine with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors [see Boxed Warning]. Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely. The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets are exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. Lamotrigine ODT Patient Titration Kits provide lamotrigine at doses consistent with the recommended titration schedule for the first 5 weeks of treatment, based upon concomitant medications, for patients with epilepsy (older than 12 years) and bipolar I disorder (adults) and are intended to help reduce the potential for rash. The use of lamotrigine ODT Patient Titration Kits is recommended for appropriate patients who are starting or restarting lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. It is recommended that lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets, the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed. The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other concomitant medications [see Clinical pharmacology (12.3)]. Lamotrigine Added to Drugs Known to Induce or Inhibit Glucuronidation Because lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets are metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Valproate inhibits glucuronidation. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in patients on estrogen-containing contraceptives and atazanavir/ritonavir, see below and Table 13. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Tables 1, 2, 5 to 6, and 13. Target Plasma Levels for Patients with Epilepsy or Bipolar Disorder A therapeutic plasma concentration range has not been established for lamotrigine. Dosing of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be based on therapeutic response [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives Starting Lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: Although estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the clearance of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be necessary solely based on the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 5, and 7). See below for adjustments to maintenance doses of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Adjustments to the Maintenance Dose of Lamotrigine in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: (1) Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives : In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold over the recommended target maintenance dose to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. (2) Starting Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives: In women taking a stable dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Tables 1 and 5) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be necessary. (3) Stopping Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives : In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the maintenance dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets will in most cases need to be decreased by as much as 50% in order to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The decrease in dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should not exceed 25% of the total daily dose per week over a 2-week period, unless clinical response or lamotrigine plasma levels indicate otherwise [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In women taking lamotrigine in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be necessary. Women and Other Hormonal Contraceptive Preparations or Hormone Replacement Therapy The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. Patients Taking Atazanavir/Ritonavir While atazanavir/ritonavir does reduce the lamotrigine plasma concentration, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be necessary solely based on the use of atazanavir/ritonavir. Dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets based on concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 2, and 5). In patients already taking maintenance doses of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets and not taking glucuronidation inducers, the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets may need to be increased if atazanavir/ritonavir is added, or decreased if atazanavir/ritonavir is discontinued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response. Patients with Renal Impairment Initial doses of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be based on patients’ concomitant medications (see Tables 1 to 3 and 5); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be used with caution in these patients. Discontinuation Strategy Epilepsy : For patients receiving lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed. If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets, a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine; discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine. Bipolar Disorder: In the controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, type, or severity of adverse reactions following abrupt termination of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets. In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets. Discontinuation of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should involve a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. 2.2 Epilepsy - Adjunctive Therapy This section provides specific dosing recommendations for patients older than 12 years and patients aged 2 to 12 years. Within each of these age-groups, specific dosing recommendations are provided depending upon the concomitant AEDs or other concomitant medications (see Table 1 for patients older than 12 years and Table 2 for patients aged 2 to 12 years). A weight-based dosing guide for patients aged 2 to 12 years on concomitant valproate is provided in Table 3. Patients Older than 12 Years Recommended dosing guidelines are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Escalation Regimen for Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in Patients Older than 12 Years with Epilepsy In Patients TAKING Valproate a In Patients NOT TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, b or Valproate a In Patients TAKING Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone b and NOT TAKING Valproate a Weeks 1 and 2 25 mg every other day 25 mg every day 50 mg/day Weeks 3 and 4 25 mg every day 50 mg/day 100 mg/day (in 2 divided doses) Week 5 onward to maintenance Increase by 25 to 50 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks. Increase by 50 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks. Increase by 100 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks. Usual maintenance dose 100 to 200 mg/day with valproate alone 100 to 400 mg/day with valproate and other drugs that induce glucuronidation (in 1 or 2 divided doses) 225 to 375 mg/day (in 2 divided doses) 300 to 500 mg/day (in 2 divided doses) a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. b Drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, other than the specified antiepileptic drugs, include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years Recommended dosing guidelines are summarized in Table 2. Lower starting doses and slower dose escalations than those used in clinical trials are recommended because of the suggestion that the risk of rash may be decreased by lower starting doses and slower dose escalations. Therefore, maintenance doses will take longer to reach in clinical practice than in clinical trials. It may take several weeks to months to achieve an individualized maintenance dose. Maintenance doses in patients weighing <30 kg, regardless of age or concomitant AED, may need to be increased as much as 50%, based on clinical response. Table 2.

The dose should be increased every 1 to 2 weeks as follows: calculate 0.6 mg/kg/day, round this amount down to the nearest whole tablet, and add this amount to the previously administered daily dose. The dose should be increased every 1 to 2 weeks as follows: calculate 1.2 mg/kg/day, round this amount down to the nearest whole tablet, and add this amount to the previously administered daily dose. Usual maintenance dose 1 to 5 mg/kg/day (maximum 200 mg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses) 1 to 3 mg/kg/day with valproate alone 4.5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day (maximum 300 mg/day in 2 divided doses) 5 to 15 mg/kg/day (maximum 400 mg/day in 2 divided doses) Maintenance dose in patients <30 kg May need to be increased by as much as 50%, based on clinical response. May need to be increased by as much as 50%, based on clinical response. May need to be increased by as much as 50%, based on clinical response. Note: Only whole tablets should be used for dosing. a Valproate has been shown to inhibit glucuronidation and decrease the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. b Drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation and increase clearance, other than the specified antiepileptic drugs, include estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Table 3. The Initial Weight-Based Dosing Guide for Patients Aged 2 to 12 Years Taking Valproate (Weeks 1 to 4) with Epilepsy If the patient’s weight is Give this daily dose, using the most appropriate combination of lamotrigine 2- and 5-mg tablets Greater than And less than Weeks 1 and 2 Weeks 3 and 4 6.7 kg 14 kg 2 mg every other day 2 mg every day 14.1 kg 27 kg 2 mg every day 4 mg every day 27.1 kg 34 kg 4 mg every day 8 mg every day 34.1 kg 40 kg 5 mg every day 10 mg every day Usual Adjunctive Maintenance Dose for Epilepsy The usual maintenance doses identified in Tables 1 and 2 are derived from dosing regimens employed in the placebo-controlled adjunctive trials in which the efficacy of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets was established. In patients receiving multidrug regimens employing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone without valproate , maintenance doses of adjunctive lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets as high as 700 mg/day have been used. In patients receiving valproate alone , maintenance doses of adjunctive lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets as high as 200 mg/day have been used. The advantage of using doses above those recommended in Tables 1 to 4 has not been established in controlled trials. 2.3 Epilepsy - Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy to Monotherapy The goal of the transition regimen is to attempt to maintain seizure control while mitigating the risk of serious rash associated with the rapid titration of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets. The recommended maintenance dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets as monotherapy is 500 mg/day given in 2 divided doses. To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations for lamotrigine should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning]. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, or Primidone to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Orally Disintegrating Tablets After achieving a dose of 500 mg/day of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets using the guidelines in Table 1, the concomitant enzyme-inducing AED should be withdrawn by 20% decrements each week over a 4-week period. The regimen for the withdrawal of the concomitant AED is based on experience gained in the controlled monotherapy clinical trial. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets The conversion regimen involves the 4 steps outlined in Table 4. Table 4. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in Patients Aged 16 Years and Older with Epilepsy Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets Valproate Step 1 Achieve a dose of 200 mg/day according to guidelines in Table 1. Maintain established stable dose. Step 2 Maintain at 200 mg/day. Decrease dose by decrements no greater than 500 mg/day/week to 500 mg/day and then maintain for 1 week. Step 3 Increase to 300 mg/day and maintain for 1 week. Simultaneously decrease to 250 mg/day and maintain for 1 week. Step 4 Increase by 100 mg/day every week to achieve maintenance dose of 500 mg/day. Discontinue. Conversion from Adjunctive Therapy with Antiepileptic Drugs other than Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate to Monotherapy with Lamotrigine Orally Disintegrating Tablets No specific dosing guidelines can be provided for conversion to monotherapy with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets with AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate. 2.4 Bipolar Disorder The goal of maintenance treatment with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablet is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2)] . Patients taking lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Adults The target dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablet is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended. Treatment with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets are introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated. If other drugs are subsequently introduced, the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets may need to be adjusted. In particular, the introduction of valproate requires reduction in the dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning]. Table 5.

Dosing recommendations for oral contraceptives and the protease inhibitor atazanavir/ritonavir can be found in General Dosing Considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Patients on rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir should follow the same dosing titration/maintenance regimen used with antiepileptic drugs that induce glucuronidation and increase clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

(Boxed Warning, 5.1) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: Consider this diagnosis and evaluate patients immediately if they develop signs or symptoms of systemic inflammation. Discontinue lamotrigine if an alternative etiology is not established. (5.2) Fatal or life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, may be fatal or life threatening. Early signs may include rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. These reactions may be associated with other organ involvement, such as hepatitis, hepatic failure, blood dyscrasias, or acute multiorgan failure. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if alternate etiology for this reaction is not found. (5.3) Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia): May occur, either with or without an associated hypersensitivity syndrome. Monitor for signs of anemia, unexpected infection, or bleeding. (5.4) Suicidal behavior and ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. (5.5) Aseptic meningitis: Monitor for signs of meningitis. (5.6) Medication errors due to product name confusion: Strongly advise patients to visually inspect tablets to verify the received drug is correct. (5.7, 16, 17) 5.1 Serious Skin Rashes [see Boxed Warning] Pediatric Population The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years) is approximately 0.3% to 0.8%. One rash-related death was reported in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in U.S. and foreign postmarketing experience. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate. Adult Population Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In the bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multi-organ hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized. Patients with History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic Drugs The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. 5.2 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has occurred in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Common findings include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver function and coagulation abnormalities. In cases of HLH reported with lamotrigine, patients have presented with signs of systemic inflammation (fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and organ system dysfunction) and blood dyscrasias. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 8 to 24 days following the initiation of treatment. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.3 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use. Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately. 5.4 Blood Dyscrasias There have been reports of blood dyscrasias that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia. 5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation AEDs, including lamotrigine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 7 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 7. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients With Events per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients With Events per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients With Events per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.6 Aseptic Meningitis Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate. Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 5.7 Potential Medication Errors Medication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine clearly. Depictions of Lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription. 5.8 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur. 5.9 Withdrawal Seizures As with other AEDs, lamotrigine should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In clinical trials in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine should be tapered over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 5.10 Status Epilepticus Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made. 5.11 Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for a recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect. 5.12 Addition of Lamotrigine to a Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.13 Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in 1 controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigine's binding to melanin is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects. 5.14 Laboratory Tests False-Positive Drug Test Results Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result. Plasma Concentrations of Lamotrigine The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 13), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.""]","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described in more detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the labeling: Serious Skin Rashes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Blood Dyscrasias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Aseptic meningitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Withdrawal seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] Epilepsy: Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) in adults were dizziness, headache, diplopia, ataxia, nausea, blurred vision, somnolence, rhinitis, pharyngitis, and rash. Additional adverse reactions (incidence ≥10%) reported in children included vomiting, infection, fever, accidental injury, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and tremor. (6.1) Bipolar disorder: Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) in adults were nausea, insomnia, somnolence, back pain, fatigue, rash, rhinitis, abdominal pain, and xerostomia. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical at 1-800-828- 9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Epilepsy Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Clinical Trials : Adjunctive Therapy in Adults w ith Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (≥5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with lamotrigine during adjunctive therapy in adults and not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were: dizziness, ataxia, somnolence, headache, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting were dose-related. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision occurred more commonly in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine. Clinical data suggest a higher incidence of rash, including serious rash, in patients receiving concomitant valproate than in patients not receiving valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Approximately 11% of the 3,378 adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (3.0%), dizziness (2.8%), and headache (2.5%). In a dose-response trial in adults, the rate of discontinuation of lamotrigine for dizziness, ataxia, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting was dose related. Monotherapy in Adults w ith Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (≥5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine during the monotherapy phase of the controlled trial in adults not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were vomiting, coordination abnormality, dyspepsia, nausea, dizziness, rhinitis, anxiety, insomnia, infection, pain, weight decrease, chest pain, and dysmenorrhea. The most commonly observed (≥5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions associated with the use of lamotrigine during the conversion to monotherapy (add-on) period, not seen at an equivalent frequency among low-dose valproate-treated patients, were dizziness, headache, nausea, asthenia, coordination abnormality, vomiting, rash, somnolence, diplopia, ataxia, accidental injury, tremor, blurred vision, insomnia, nystagmus, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, pruritus, and sinusitis. Approximately 10% of the 420 adult patients who received lamotrigine as monotherapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.5%), headache (3.1%), and asthenia (2.4%). Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric Patients w ith Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (≥5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment in pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years and not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were infection, vomiting, rash, fever, somnolence, accidental injury, dizziness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, ataxia, tremor, asthenia, bronchitis, flu syndrome, and diplopia. In 339 patients aged 2 to 16 years with partial-onset seizures or generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 4.2% of patients on lamotrigine and 2.9% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reaction that led to discontinuation of lamotrigine was rash. Approximately 11.5% of the 1,081 pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.4%), reaction aggravated (1.7%), and ataxia (0.6%). Controlled Adjunctive Clinical Trials in Adults w ith Epilepsy: Table 8 lists adverse reactions that occurred in adult patients with epilepsy treated with lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, either lamotrigine or placebo was added to the patient’s current AED therapy. Table 8. Adverse Reactions in Pooled, Placebo-Controlled Adjunctive Trials in Adult Patients with Epilepsy a,b Body System/ Adverse Reaction Percent of Patients Receiving Adjunctive Lamotrigine (n = 711) Percent of Patients Receiving Adjunctive Placebo (n = 419) Body as a whole Headache 29 19 Flu syndrome 7 6 Fever 6 4 Abdominal pain 5 4 Neck pain 2 1 Reaction aggravated (seizure exacerbation) 2 1 Digestive Nausea 19 10 Vomiting 9 4 Diarrhea 6 4 Dyspepsia 5 2 Constipation 4 3 Anorexia 2 1 Musculoskeletal Arthralgia 2 0 Nervous Dizziness 38 13 Ataxia 22 6 Somnolence 14 7 Incoordination 6 2 Insomnia 6 2 Tremor 4 1 Depression 4 3 Anxiety 4 3 Convulsion 3 1 Irritability 3 2 Speech disorder 3 0 Concentration disturbance 2 1 Respiratory Rhinitis 14 9 Pharyngitis 10 9 Cough increased 8 6 Skin and appendages Rash 10 5 Pruritus 3 2 Special senses Diplopia 28 7 Blurred vision 16 5 Vision abnormality 3 1 Urogenital Female patients only (n = 365) (n = 207) Dysmenorrhea 7 6 Vaginitis 4 1 Amenorrhea 2 1 a Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with lamotrigine and at a greater incidence than placebo. b Patients in these adjunctive trials were receiving 1 to 3 of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone in addition to lamotrigine or placebo. Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial or at discontinuation; thus, patients may be included in more than 1 category. In a randomized, parallel trial comparing placebo with 300 and 500 mg/day of lamotrigine, some of the more common drug-related adverse reactions were dose related (see Table 9). Table 9. Dose-Related Adverse Reactions from a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Adjunctive Trial in Adults with Epilepsy Adverse Reaction Percent of Patients Experiencing Adverse Reactions Placebo (n = 73) Lamotrigine 300 mg (n = 71) Lamotrigine 500 mg (n = 72) Ataxia 10 10 28 a,b Blurred vision 10 11 25 a,b Diplopia 8 24 a 49 a,b Dizziness 27 31 54 a,b Nausea 11 18 25 a Vomiting 4 11 18 a a Significantly greater than placebo group ( P <0.05). b Significantly greater than group receiving lamotrigine 300 mg ( P <0.05). The overall adverse reaction profile for lamotrigine was similar between females and males and was independent of age. Because the largest non-Caucasian racial subgroup was only 6% of patients exposed to lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reaction reports by race. Generally, females receiving either lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy or placebo were more likely to report adverse reactions than males. The only adverse reaction for which the reports on lamotrigine were > 10% more frequent in females than males (without a corresponding difference by gender on placebo) was dizziness (difference = 16.5%). There was little difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of lamotrigine for individual adverse reactions. Controlled Monotherapy Trial in Adults w ith Partial-Onset Seizures: Table 10 lists adverse reactions that occurred in patients with epilepsy treated with monotherapy with lamotrigine in a double-blind trial following discontinuation of either concomitant carbamazepine or phenytoin not seen at an equivalent frequency in the control group.

Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial; thus, patients may be included in more than 1 category. c Up to 500 mg/day. d 1,000 mg/day. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of < 5% and > 2% of patients receiving lamotrigine and numerically more frequent than placebo were: Body as a Whole: Asthenia, fever.

Incidence in Controlled Adjunctive Trials in Pediatric Patients w ith Epilepsy: Table 11 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 339 pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures or generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who received lamotrigine up to 15 mg/kg/day or a maximum of 750 mg/day. Table 11.

Bipolar Disorder in Adults The most common adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine as monotherapy (100 to 400 mg/day) in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) with bipolar disorder in the 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 18 months’ duration are included in Table 12. Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients and were numerically more frequent during the dose-escalation phase of lamotrigine in these trials (when patients may have been receiving concomitant medications) compared with the monotherapy phase were: headache (25%), rash (11%), dizziness (10%), diarrhea (8%), dream abnormality (6%), and pruritus (6%). During the monotherapy phase of the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 18 months’ duration, 13% of 227 patients who received lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day), 16% of 190 patients who received placebo, and 23% of 166 patients who received lithium discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuation of lamotrigine were rash (3%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). Approximately 16% of 2,401 patients who received lamotrigine (50 to 500 mg/day) for bipolar disorder in premarketing trials discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction, most commonly due to rash (5%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). The overall adverse reaction profile for lamotrigine was similar between females and males, between elderly and nonelderly patients, and among racial groups. Table 12. Adverse Reactions in 2 Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adult Patients with Bipolar I Disorder a,b Body System/ Adverse Reaction Percent of Patients Receiving Lamotrigine (n = 227) Percent of Patients Receiving Placebo (n = 190) General Back pain 8 6 Fatigue 8 5 Abdominal pain 6 3 Digestive Nausea 14 11 Constipation 5 2 Vomiting 5 2 Nervous System Insomnia 10 6 Somnolence 9 7 Xerostomia (dry mouth) 6 4 Respiratory Rhinitis 7 4 Exacerbation of cough 5 3 Pharyngitis 5 4 Skin Rash (nonserious) c 7 5 a Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with lamotrigine and at a greater incidence than placebo. b Patients in these trials were converted to lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day) or placebo monotherapy from add-on therapy with other psychotropic medications. Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial; thus, patients may be included in more than 1 category. c In the overall bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Other reactions that occurred in 5% or more patients but equally or more frequently in the placebo group included: dizziness, mania, headache, infection, influenza, pain, accidental injury, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of < 5% and > 1% of patients receiving lamotrigine and numerically more frequent than placebo were: General: Fever, neck pain. Cardiovascular: Migraine. Digestive: Flatulence. Metabolic and Nutritional: Weight gain, edema. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia. Nervous System: Amnesia, depression, agitation, emotional lability, dyspraxia, abnormal thoughts, dream abnormality, hypoesthesia. Respiratory: Sinusitis. Urogenital: Urinary frequency. Adverse Reactions following Abrupt Discontinuation : In the 2 controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, severity, or type of adverse reactions in patients with bipolar disorder after abruptly terminating therapy with lamotrigine. In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . Mania/Hypomania/Mixed Episodes: During the double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials in bipolar I disorder in which adults were converted to monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400-mg/day) from other psychotropic medications and followed for up to 18 months, the rates of manic or hypomanic or mixed mood episodes reported as adverse reactions were 5% for patients treated with lamotrigine (n = 227), 4% for patients treated with lithium (n = 166), and 7% for patients treated with placebo (n = 190). In all bipolar controlled trials combined, adverse reactions of mania (including hypomania and mixed mood episodes) were reported in 5% of patients treated with lamotrigine (n = 956), 3% of patients treated with lithium (n = 280), and 4% of patients treated with placebo (n = 803). 6.2 Other Adverse Reactions Observed in All Clinical Trials Lamotrigine has been administered to 6,694 individuals for whom complete adverse reaction data was captured during all clinical trials, only some of which were placebo controlled. During these trials, all adverse reactions were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse reactions, similar types of adverse reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 6,694 individuals exposed to lamotrigine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving lamotrigine. All reported adverse reactions are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Adverse reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy not associated with hypersensitivity disorder. Gastrointestinal Esophagitis. Hepatobiliary Tract and Pancreas Pancreatitis. Immunologic Hypogammaglobulinemia, lupus-like reaction, vasculitis. Lower Respiratory Apnea. Musculoskeletal Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing hypersensitivity reactions. Nervous System Aggression, exacerbation of Parkinsonian symptoms in patients with pre-existing Parkinson’s disease, tics. Non-site Specific Progressive immunosuppression.']","['<table> <col/> <col/> <col/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign=""top"" styleCode=""     Botrule          Toprule         Lrule          Rrule     "">

interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section. Uridine 5´-diphospho-glucuronyl transferases (UGT) have been identified as the enzymes responsible for metabolism of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce or inhibit glucuronidation may, therefore, affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Strong or moderate inducers of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, which are also known to induce UGT, may also enhance the metabolism of lamotrigine. Those drugs that have been demonstrated to have a clinically significant impact on lamotrigine metabolism are outlined in Table 13. Specific dosing guidance for these drugs is provided in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Additional details of these drug interaction studies are provided in the Clinical Pharmacology section [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Table 13. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Concomitant Drug Effect on Concentration of Lamotrigine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Estrogen-containing oral contraceptive preparations containing 30 mcg ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel ↓ lamotrigine ↓ levonorgestrel Decreased lamotrigine concentrations approximately 50%. Decrease in levonorgestrel component by 19%. Carbamazepine and carbamazepine epoxide ↓ lamotrigine ? carbamazepine epoxide Addition of carbamazepine decreases lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. May increase carbamazepine epoxide levels. Lopinavir/ritonavir ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 50%. Atazanavir/ritonavir ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine AUC approximately 32%. Phenobarbital/Primidone ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. Phenytoin ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine concentration approximately 40%. Rifampin ↓ lamotrigine Decreased lamotrigine AUC approximately 40%. Valproate ↑ lamotrigine ? valproate Increased lamotrigine concentrations slightly more than 2-fold. There are conflicting study results regarding effect of lamotrigine on valproate concentrations: 1) a mean 25% decrease in valproate concentrations in healthy volunteers, 2) no change in valproate concentrations in controlled clinical trials in patients with epilepsy. ↓= Decreased (induces lamotrigine glucuronidation). ↑= Increased (inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation). ? = Conflicting data. Effect of lamotrigine on Organic Cationic Transporter 2 Substrates Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs that are substantially excreted via this route. Coadministration of lamotrigine with OCT2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., dofetilide) is not recommended. Valproate increases lamotrigine concentrations more than 2-fold. (7, 12.3) Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and rifampin decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 40%. (7, 12.3) Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives decrease lamotrigine concentrations by approximately 50%. (7, 12.3) Protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/lopinavir decrease lamotrigine exposure by approximately 50% and 32%, respectively. (7, 12.3) Coadministration with organic cationic transporter 2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index is not recommended (7, 12.3)']","['8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data may cause fetal harm. (8.1) Hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustments required in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment. (2.1, 8.6) Renal impairment: Reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment.(2.1, 8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, including lamotrigine, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking lamotrigine during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary Data from several prospective pregnancy exposure registries and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of major congenital malformations or a consistent pattern of malformations among women exposed to lamotrigine compared with the general population (see Data) . The majority of lamotrigine pregnancy exposure data are from women with epilepsy. In animal studies, administration of lamotrigine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (increased mortality, decreased body weight, increased structural variation, neurobehavioral abnormalities) at doses lower than those administered clinically. Lamotrigine decreased fetal folate concentrations in rats, an effect known to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in animals and humans (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations As with other AEDs, physiological changes during pregnancy may affect lamotrigine concentrations and/or therapeutic effect. There have been reports of decreased lamotrigine concentrations during pregnancy and restoration of pre-pregnancy concentrations after delivery. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response. Data Human Data: Data from several international pregnancy registries have not shown an increased risk for malformations overall. The International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations in 2.2% (95% CI: 1.6%, 3.1%) of 1,558 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations among 2.0% of 1,562 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. EURAP, a large international pregnancy registry focused outside of North America, reported major birth defects in 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 3.7%) of 2,514 exposures to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. The frequency of major congenital malformations was similar to estimates from the general population. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry observed an increased risk of isolated oral clefts: among 2,200 infants exposed to lamotrigine early in pregnancy, the risk of oral clefts was 3.2 per 1,000 (95% CI: 1.4, 6.3), a 3-fold increased risk versus unexposed healthy controls. This finding has not been observed in other large international pregnancy registries. Furthermore, a case-control study based on 21 congenital anomaly registries covering over 10 million births in Europe reported an adjusted odds ratio for isolated oral clefts with lamotrigine exposure of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.63). Several meta-analyses have not reported an increased risk of major congenital malformations following lamotrigine exposure in pregnancy compared with healthy and disease-matched controls. No patterns of specific malformation types were observed. The same meta-analyses evaluated the risk of additional maternal and infant outcomes including fetal death, stillbirth, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and neurodevelopmental delay. Although there are no data suggesting an increased risk of these outcomes with lamotrigine monotherapy exposure, differences in outcome definition, ascertainment methods, and comparator groups limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Animal Data: When lamotrigine was administered to pregnant mice, rats, or rabbits during the period of organogenesis (oral doses of up to 125, 25, and 30 mg/kg, respectively), reduced fetal body weight and increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen in mice and rats at doses that were also maternally toxic. The no-effect doses for embryofetal developmental toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits (75, 6.25, and 30 mg/kg, respectively) are similar to (mice and rabbits) or less than (rats) the human dose of 400 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. In a study in which pregnant rats were administered lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5 or 25 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis and offspring were evaluated postnatally, neurobehavioral abnormalities were observed in exposed offspring at both doses. The lowest effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats is less than the human dose of 400 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Maternal toxicity was observed at the higher dose tested. When pregnant rats were administered lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation, increased offspring mortality (including stillbirths) was seen at all doses. The lowest effect dose for pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity in rats is less than the human dose of 400 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Maternal toxicity was observed at the 2 highest doses tested. When administered to pregnant rats, lamotrigine decreased fetal folate concentrations at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/kg/day, which is less than the human dose of 400 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Lamotrigine is present in milk from lactating women taking lamotrigine (see Data) . Neonates and young infants are at risk for high serum levels because maternal serum and milk levels can rise to high levels postpartum if lamotrigine dosage has been increased during pregnancy but is not reduced after delivery to the pre-pregnancy dosage. Glucuronidation is required for drug clearance. Glucuronidation capacity is immature in the infant and this may also contribute to the level of lamotrigine exposure. Events including rash, apnea, drowsiness, poor sucking, and poor weight gain (requiring hospitalization in some cases) have been reported in infants who have been human milk-fed by mothers using lamotrigine; whether or not these events were caused by lamotrigine is unknown. No data are available on the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for lamotrigine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lamotrigine or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Human milk-fed infants should be closely monitored for adverse events resulting from lamotrigine. Measurement of infant serum levels should be performed to rule out toxicity if concerns arise. Human milk-feeding should be discontinued in infants with lamotrigine toxicity. Data Data from multiple small studies indicate that lamotrigine plasma levels in nursing infants have been reported to be as high as 50% of maternal plasma concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use Epilepsy Lamotrigine is indicated as adjunctive therapy in patients aged 2 years and older for partial-onset seizures, the generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and PGTC seizures. Safety and efficacy of lamotrigine used as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures were not demonstrated in a small, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial in very young pediatric patients (aged 1 to 24 months). Lamotrigine was associated with an increased risk for infectious adverse reactions (lamotrigine 37%, placebo 5%), and respiratory adverse reactions (lamotrigine 26%, placebo 5%). Infectious adverse reactions included bronchiolitis, bronchitis, ear infection, eye infection, otitis externa, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and viral infection. Respiratory adverse reactions included nasal congestion, cough, and apnea. Bipolar Disorder Safety and efficacy of lamotrigine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder were not established in a double-blind, randomized withdrawal, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated 301 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with a current manic/hypomanic, depressed, or mixed mood episode as defined by DSM-IV-TR. In the randomized phase of the trial, adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients taking lamotrigine (n = 87) and were twice as common compared with patients taking placebo (n = 86) were influenza (lamotrigine 8%, placebo 2%), oropharyngeal pain (lamotrigine 8%, placebo 2%), vomiting (lamotrigine 6%, placebo 2%), contact dermatitis (lamotrigine 5%, placebo 2%), upper abdominal pain (lamotrigine 5%, placebo 1%), and suicidal ideation (lamotrigine 5%, placebo 0%). Juvenile Animal Data In a juvenile animal study in which lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg) was administered to young rats from postnatal day 7 to 62, decreased viability and growth were seen at the highest dose tested and long-term Neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased locomotor activity, increased reactivity, and learning deficits in animals tested as adults) were observed at the 2 highest doses. The no-effect dose for adverse developmental effects in juvenile animals is less than the human dose of 400 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of lamotrigine for epilepsy and bipolar disorder did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients or exhibit a different safety profile than that of younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Lamotrigine is metabolized mainly by glucuronic acid conjugation, with the majority of the metabolites being recovered in the urine. In a small study comparing a single dose of lamotrigine in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment with healthy volunteers, the plasma half-life of lamotrigine was approximately twice as long in the subjects with chronic renal failure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Initial doses of lamotrigine should be based on patients’ AED regimens; reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with lamotrigine. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine should be used with caution in these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].']","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, including lamotrigine, during pregnancy.

In animal models designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, lamotrigine was effective in preventing seizure spread in the maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) tests, and prevented seizures in the visually and electrically evoked after-discharge (EEAD) tests for antiepileptic activity. Lamotrigine also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, however, is not known. One proposed mechanism of action of lamotrigine, the relevance of which remains to be established in humans, involves an effect on sodium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and aspartate). Effect of Lamotrigine on N-Methyl d-Aspartate-Receptor Mediated Activity Lamotrigine did not inhibit N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced depolarizations in rat cortical slices or NMDA-induced cyclic GMP formation in immature rat cerebellum, nor did lamotrigine displace compounds that are either competitive or noncompetitive ligands at this glutamate receptor complex (CNQX, CGS, TCHP). The IC 50 for lamotrigine effects on NMDA-induced currents (in the presence of 3 µM of glycine) in cultured hippocampal neurons exceeded 100 µM. The mechanisms by which lamotrigine exerts its therapeutic action in bipolar disorder have not been established. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Folate Metabolism In vitro , lamotrigine inhibited dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this enzyme may interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. When oral daily doses of lamotrigine were given to pregnant rats during organogenesis, fetal, placental, and maternal folate concentrations were reduced. Significantly reduced concentrations of folate are associated with teratogenesis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Folate concentrations were also reduced in male rats given repeated oral doses of lamotrigine. Reduced concentrations were partially returned to normal when supplemented with folinic acid. Accumulation in Kidneys Lamotrigine accumulated in the kidney of the male rat, causing chronic progressive nephrosis, necrosis, and mineralization. These findings are attributed to α-2 microglobulin, a species- and sex-specific protein that has not been detected in humans or other animal species. Melanin Binding Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues, e.g., in the eye and pigmented skin. It has been found in the uveal tract up to 52 weeks after a single dose in rodents. Cardiovascular In dogs, lamotrigine is extensively metabolized to a 2-N-methyl metabolite. This metabolite causes dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and, at higher doses, complete AV conduction block. Similar cardiovascular effects are not anticipated in humans because only trace amounts of the 2-N-methyl metabolite (<0.6% of lamotrigine dose) have been found in human urine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . However, it is conceivable that plasma concentrations of this metabolite could be increased in patients with a reduced capacity to glucuronidate lamotrigine (e.g., in patients with liver disease, patients taking concomitant medications that inhibit glucuronidation). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine have been studied in subjects with epilepsy, healthy young and elderly volunteers, and volunteers with chronic renal failure. Lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters for adult and pediatric subjects and healthy normal volunteers are summarized in Tables 14 and 16. Table 14. Mean Pharmacokinetic Parameters a in Healthy Volunteers and Adult Subjects with Epilepsy Adult Study Population Number of Subjects T max : Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (h) t ½ :Elimination Half-life (h) Cl/F: Apparent Plasma Clearance (mL/min/kg) Healthy volunteers taking no other medications: Single-dose lamotrigine 179 2.2 (0.25 to 2.0) 32.8 (14.0 to 103.0) 0.44 (0.12 to 1.10) Multiple-dose lamotrigine 36 1.7 (0.5 to 4.0) 25.4 (11.6 to 61.6) 0.58 (0.24 to 1.15) Healthy volunteers taking valproate: Single-dose lamotrigine 6 1.8 (1.0 to 4.0) 48.3 (31.5 to 88.6) 0.30 (0.14 to 0.42) Multiple-dose lamotrigine 18 1.9 (0.5 to 3.5) 70.3 (41.9 to 113.5) 0.18 (0.12 to 0.33) Subjects with epilepsy taking valproate only: Single-dose lamotrigine 4 4.8 (1.8 to 8.4) 58.8 (30.5 to 88.8) 0.28 (0.16 to 0.40) Subjects with epilepsy taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone b plus valproate: Single-dose lamotrigine 25 3.8 (1.0 to 10.0) 27.2 (11.2 to 51.6) 0.53 (0.27 to 1.04) Subjects with epilepsy taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone: b Single-dose lamotrigine 24 2.3 (0.5 to 5.0) 14.4 (6.4 to 30.4) 1.10 (0.51 to 2.22) Multiple-dose lamotrigine 17 2.0 (0.75 to 5.93) 12.6 (7.5 to 23.1) 1.21 (0.66 to 1.82) a The majority of parameter means determined in each study had coefficients of variation between 20% and 40% for half-life and CL/F and between 30% and 70% for T max. The overall mean values were calculated from individual study means that were weighted based on the number of volunteers/subjects in each study. The numbers in parentheses below each parameter mean represent the range of individual volunteer/subject values across studies. b Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone have been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and other drugs, such as rifampin and protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir, that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation have also been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Absorption Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass metabolism (absolute bioavailability is 98%). The bioavailability is not affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations occur anywhere from 1.4 to 4.8 hours following drug administration. The lamotrigine chewable/dispersible tablets were found to be equivalent whether administered as dispersed in water, chewed and swallowed, or swallowed whole, to the lamotrigine compressed tablets in terms of rate and extent of absorption. In terms of rate and extent of absorption, lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets, whether disintegrated in the mouth or swallowed whole with water, were equivalent to the lamotrigine compressed tablets swallowed with water. Dose Proportionality In healthy volunteers not receiving any other medications and given single doses, the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine increased in direct proportion to the dose administered over the range of 50 to 400 mg. In 2 small studies (n = 7 and 8) of patients with epilepsy who were maintained on other AEDs, there also was a linear relationship between dose and lamotrigine plasma concentrations at steady-state following doses of 50 to 350 mg twice daily. Distribution Estimates of the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of lamotrigine following oral administration ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. Vd/F is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers. Protein Binding Data from in vitro studies indicate that lamotrigine is approximately 55% bound to human plasma proteins at plasma lamotrigine concentrations from 1 to 10 mcg/mL (10 mcg/mL is 4 to 6 times the trough plasma concentration observed in the controlled efficacy trials). Because lamotrigine is not highly bound to plasma proteins, clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely. The binding of lamotrigine to plasma proteins did not change in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate. Lamotrigine did not displace other AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) from protein-binding sites. Metabolism Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation; the major metabolite is an inactive 2-N-glucuronide conjugate. After oral administration of 240 mg of 14 C-lamotrigine (15 μCi) to 6 healthy volunteers, 94% was recovered in the urine and 2% was recovered in the feces. The radioactivity in the urine consisted of unchanged lamotrigine (10%), the 2-N-glucuronide (76%), a 5-N-glucuronide (10%), a 2-N-methyl metabolite (0.14%), and other unidentified minor metabolites (4%). Enzyme Induction The effects of lamotrigine on the induction of specific families of mixed-function oxidase isozymes have not been systematically evaluated. Following multiple administrations (150 mg twice daily) to normal volunteers taking no other medications, lamotrigine induced its own metabolism, resulting in a 25% decrease in t ½ and a 37% increase in CL/F at steady-state compared with values obtained in the same volunteers following a single dose. Evidence gathered from other sources suggests that self-induction by lamotrigine may not occur when lamotrigine is given as adjunctive therapy in patients receiving enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Elimination The elimination half-life and apparent clearance of lamotrigine following oral administration of lamotrigine to adult subjects with epilepsy and healthy volunteers is summarized in Table 14. Half-life and apparent oral clearance vary depending on concomitant AEDs. Drug Interactions The apparent clearance of lamotrigine is affected by the coadministration of certain medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.12), Drug Interactions (7)]. The net effects of drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in Tables 13 and 15, followed by details of the drug interaction studies below. Table 15.

Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives In 16 female volunteers, an oral contraceptive preparation containing 30 mcg ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel increased the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (300 mg/day) by approximately 2-fold with mean decreases in AUC of 52% and in C max of 39%. In this study, trough serum lamotrigine concentrations gradually increased and were approximately 2-fold higher on average at the end of the week of the inactive hormone preparation compared with trough lamotrigine concentrations at the end of the active hormone cycle. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels (approximate 2-fold increase) occurred during the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) for women not also taking a drug that increased the clearance of lamotrigine (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The increase in lamotrigine plasma levels will be greater if the dose of lamotrigine is increased in the few days before or during the pill-free week. Increases in lamotrigine plasma levels could result in dose-dependent adverse reactions. In the same study, coadministration of lamotrigine (300 mg/day) in 16 female volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the ethinylestradiol component of the oral contraceptive preparation. There were mean decreases in the AUC and C max of the levonorgestrel component of 19% and 12%, respectively. Measurement of serum progesterone indicated that there was no hormonal evidence of ovulation in any of the 16 volunteers, although measurement of serum FSH, LH, and estradiol indicated that there was some loss of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The effects of doses of lamotrigine other than 300 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The clinical significance of the observed hormonal changes on ovulatory activity is unknown. However, the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy in some patients cannot be excluded. Therefore, patients should be instructed to promptly report changes in their menstrual pattern (e.g., break-through bleeding). Dosage adjustments may be necessary for women receiving estrogen-containing oral contraceptive preparations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Other Hormonal Contraceptives or Hormone Replacement Therapy The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. Aripiprazole In 18 patients with bipolar disorder on a stable regimen of 100 to 400 mg/day of lamotrigine, the lamotrigine AUC and C max were reduced by approximately 10% in patients who received aripiprazole 10 to 30 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 30 mg/day for an additional 7 days. This reduction in lamotrigine exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. Atazanavir/Ritonavir In a study in healthy volunteers, daily doses of atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg) reduced the plasma AUC and C max of lamotrigine (single 100-mg dose) by an average of 32% and 6%, respectively, and shortened the elimination half-lives by 27%. In the presence of atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg), the metabolite-to-lamotrigine ratio was increased from 0.45 to 0.71 consistent with induction of glucuronidation. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir were similar in the presence of concomitant lamotrigine to the historical data of the pharmacokinetics in the absence of lamotrigine. Bupropion The pharmacokinetics of a 100-mg single dose of lamotrigine in healthy volunteers (n = 12) were not changed by coadministration of bupropion sustained-release formulation (150 mg twice daily) starting 11 days before lamotrigine. Carbamazepine Lamotrigine has no appreciable effect on steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentration. Limited clinical data suggest there is a higher incidence of dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unclear. The effect of lamotrigine on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine-epoxide is unclear. In a small subset of patients (n = 7) studied in a placebo-controlled trial, lamotrigine had no effect on carbamazepine-epoxide plasma concentrations, but in a small, uncontrolled study (n = 9), carbamazepine-epoxide levels increased. The addition of carbamazepine decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. Felbamate In a trial in 21 healthy volunteers, coadministration of felbamate (1,200 mg twice daily) with lamotrigine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) appeared to have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. Folate Inhibitors Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. Prescribers should be aware of this action when prescribing other medications that inhibit folate metabolism. Gabapentin Based on a retrospective analysis of plasma levels in 34 subjects who received lamotrigine both with and without gabapentin, gabapentin does not appear to change the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Lacosamide Plasma concentrations of lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant lacosamide (200, 400, or 600 mg/day) in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with partial-onset seizures. Levetiracetam Potential drug interactions between levetiracetam and lamotrigine were assessed by evaluating serum concentrations of both agents during placebo-controlled clinical trials. These data indicate that lamotrigine does not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and that levetiracetam does not influence the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. Lithium The pharmacokinetics of lithium were not altered in healthy subjects (n = 20) by coadministration of lamotrigine (100 mg/day) for 6 days. Lopinavir/Ritonavir The addition of lopinavir (400 mg twice daily)/ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC, C max , and elimination half-life of lamotrigine by approximately 50% to 55.4% in 18 healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir were similar with concomitant lamotrigine, compared with that in historical controls. Olanzapine The AUC and C max of olanzapine were similar following the addition of olanzapine (15 mg once daily) to lamotrigine (200 mg once daily) in healthy male volunteers (n = 16) compared with the AUC and C max in healthy male volunteers receiving olanzapine alone (n = 16). In the same trial, the AUC and C max of lamotrigine were reduced on average by 24% and 20%, respectively, following the addition of olanzapine to lamotrigine in healthy male volunteers compared with those receiving lamotrigine alone. This reduction in lamotrigine plasma concentrations is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Oxcarbazepine The AUC and C max of oxcarbazepine and its active 10-monohydroxy oxcarbazepine metabolite were not significantly different following the addition of oxcarbazepine (600 mg twice daily) to lamotrigine (200 mg once daily) in healthy male volunteers (n = 13) compared with healthy male volunteers receiving oxcarbazepine alone (n = 13). In the same trial, the AUC and C max of lamotrigine were similar following the addition of oxcarbazepine (600 mg twice daily) to lamotrigine in healthy male volunteers compared with those receiving lamotrigine alone. Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of headache, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence with coadministration of lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine compared with lamotrigine alone or oxcarbazepine alone. Perampanel In a pooled analysis of data from 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating adjunctive perampanel in patients with partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the highest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day) increased lamotrigine clearance by <10%. An effect of this magnitude is not considered to be clinically relevant. Phenobarbital, Primidone The addition of phenobarbital or primidone decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. Phenytoin Lamotrigine has no appreciable effect on steady-state phenytoin plasma concentrations in patients with epilepsy. The addition of phenytoin decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. Pregabalin Steady-state trough plasma concentrations of lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant pregabalin (200 mg 3 times daily) administration. There are no pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and pregabalin. Rifampin In 10 male volunteers, rifampin (600 mg/day for 5 days) significantly increased the apparent clearance of a single 25-mg dose of lamotrigine by approximately 2-fold (AUC decreased by approximately 40%). Risperidone In a 14 healthy volunteers study, multiple oral doses of lamotrigine 400 mg daily had no clinically significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of risperidone 2 mg and its active metabolite 9-OH risperidone. Following the coadministration of risperidone 2 mg with lamotrigine, 12 of the 14 volunteers reported somnolence compared with 1 out of 20 when risperidone was given alone, and none when lamotrigine was administered alone. Topiramate Topiramate resulted in no change in plasma concentrations of lamotrigine. Administration of lamotrigine resulted in a 15% increase in topiramate concentrations. Valproate When lamotrigine was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 18) receiving valproate, the trough steady-state valproate plasma concentrations decreased by an average of 25% over a 3-week period, and then stabilized. However, adding lamotrigine to the existing therapy did not cause a change in valproate plasma concentrations in either adult or pediatric patients in controlled clinical trials. The addition of valproate increased lamotrigine steady-state concentrations in normal volunteers by slightly more than 2-fold. In 1 trial, maximal inhibition of lamotrigine clearance was reached at valproate doses between 250 and 500 mg/day and did not increase as the valproate dose was further increased. Zonisamide In a study in 18 patients with epilepsy, coadministration of zonisamide (200 to 400 mg/day) with lamotrigine (150 to 500 mg/day for 35 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. Known Inducers or Inhibitors of Glucuronidation Drugs other than those listed above have not been systematically evaluated in combination with lamotrigine. Since lamotrigine is metabolized predominately by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine and doses of lamotrigine may require adjustment based on clinical response. Other In vitro assessment of the inhibitory effect of lamotrigine at OCT2 demonstrate that lamotrigine, but not the N(2)-glucuronide metabolite, is an inhibitor of OCT2 at potentially clinically relevant concentrations, with IC 50 value of 53.8 μM [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Results of in vitro experiments suggest that clearance of lamotrigine is unlikely to be reduced by concomitant administration of amitriptyline, clonazepam, clozapine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, lorazepam, phenelzine, sertraline, or trazodone. Results of in vitro experiments suggest that lamotrigine does not reduce the clearance of drugs eliminated predominantly by CYP2D6. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment : Twelve volunteers with chronic renal failure (mean creatinine clearance: 13 mL/min, range: 6 to 23) and another 6 individuals undergoing hemodialysis were each given a single 100-mg dose of lamotrigine. The mean plasma half-lives determined in the study were 42.9 hours (chronic renal failure), 13.0 hours (during hemodialysis), and 57.4 hours (between hemodialysis) compared with 26.2 hours in healthy volunteers. On average, approximately 20% (range: 5.6 to 35.1) of the amount of lamotrigine present in the body was eliminated by hemodialysis during a 4-hour session [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 100-mg dose of lamotrigine were evaluated in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification system) and compared with 12 subjects without hepatic impairment. The subjects with severe hepatic impairment were without ascites (n = 2) or with ascites (n = 5). The mean apparent clearances of lamotrigine in subjects with mild (n = 12), moderate (n = 5), severe without ascites (n = 2), and severe with ascites (n = 5) liver impairment were 0.30 ± 0.09, 0.24 ± 0.1, 0.21 ± 0.04, and 0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg, respectively, as compared with 0.37 ± 0.1 mL/min/kg in the healthy controls. Mean half-lives of lamotrigine in subjects with mild, moderate, severe without ascites, and severe with ascites hepatic impairment were 46 ± 20, 72 ± 44, 67 ± 11, and 100 ± 48 hours, respectively, as compared with 33 ± 7 hours in healthy controls [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Pediatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 2-mg/kg dose were evaluated in 2 studies in pediatric subjects (n = 29 for subjects aged 10 months to 5.9 years and n = 26 for subjects aged 5 to 11 years). Forty-three subjects received concomitant therapy with other AEDs and 12 subjects received lamotrigine as monotherapy. Lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters for pediatric patients are summarized in Table 16. Population pharmacokinetic analyses involving subjects aged 2 to 18 years demonstrated that lamotrigine clearance was influenced predominantly by total body weight and concurrent AED therapy. The oral clearance of lamotrigine was higher, on a body weight basis, in pediatric patients than in adults. Weight-normalized lamotrigine clearance was higher in those subjects weighing < 30 kg compared with those weighing >30 kg. Accordingly, patients weighing < 30 kg may need an increase of as much as 50% in maintenance doses, based on clinical response, as compared with subjects weighing > 30 kg being administered the same AEDs [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . These analyses also revealed that, after accounting for body weight, lamotrigine clearance was not significantly influenced by age. Thus, the same weight-adjusted doses should be administered to children irrespective of differences in age. Concomitant AEDs which influence lamotrigine clearance in adults were found to have similar effects in children. Table 16.

Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, rifampin, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir have also been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7)]. b Two subjects were included in the calculation for mean T max. c Parameter not estimated. Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 150-mg dose of lamotrigine were evaluated in 12 elderly volunteers between the ages of 65 and 76 years (mean creatinine clearance = 61 mL/min, range: 33 to 108 mL/min). The mean half-life of lamotrigine in these subjects was 31.2 hours (range: 24.5 to 43.4 hours), and the mean clearance was 0.40 mL/min/kg (range: 0.26 to 0.48 mL/min/kg). Male and Female Patients : The clearance of lamotrigine is not affected by gender. However, during dose escalation of lamotrigine in 1 clinical trial in patients with epilepsy on a stable dose of valproate (n = 77), mean trough lamotrigine concentrations unadjusted for weight were 24% to 45% higher (0.3 to 1.7 mcg/mL) in females than in males. Racial or Ethnic Groups : The apparent oral clearance of lamotrigine was 25% lower in non-Caucasians than Caucasians.']","['12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism(s) by which lamotrigine exerts its anticonvulsant action are unknown. In animal models designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, lamotrigine was effective in preventing seizure spread in the maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) tests, and prevented seizures in the visually and electrically evoked after-discharge (EEAD) tests for antiepileptic activity. Lamotrigine also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, however, is not known. One proposed mechanism of action of lamotrigine, the relevance of which remains to be established in humans, involves an effect on sodium channels. In vitro pharmacological studies suggest that lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and aspartate). Effect of Lamotrigine on N-Methyl d-Aspartate-Receptor Mediated Activity Lamotrigine did not inhibit N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced depolarizations in rat cortical slices or NMDA-induced cyclic GMP formation in immature rat cerebellum, nor did lamotrigine displace compounds that are either competitive or noncompetitive ligands at this glutamate receptor complex (CNQX, CGS, TCHP). The IC 50 for lamotrigine effects on NMDA-induced currents (in the presence of 3 µM of glycine) in cultured hippocampal neurons exceeded 100 µM. The mechanisms by which lamotrigine exerts its therapeutic action in bipolar disorder have not been established.']","['12.2 Pharmacodynamics Folate Metabolism In vitro , lamotrigine inhibited dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this enzyme may interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. When oral daily doses of lamotrigine were given to pregnant rats during organogenesis, fetal, placental, and maternal folate concentrations were reduced. Significantly reduced concentrations of folate are associated with teratogenesis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Folate concentrations were also reduced in male rats given repeated oral doses of lamotrigine. Reduced concentrations were partially returned to normal when supplemented with folinic acid. Accumulation in Kidneys Lamotrigine accumulated in the kidney of the male rat, causing chronic progressive nephrosis, necrosis, and mineralization. These findings are attributed to α-2 microglobulin, a species- and sex-specific protein that has not been detected in humans or other animal species. Melanin Binding Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues, e.g., in the eye and pigmented skin. It has been found in the uveal tract up to 52 weeks after a single dose in rodents. Cardiovascular In dogs, lamotrigine is extensively metabolized to a 2-N-methyl metabolite. This metabolite causes dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and, at higher doses, complete AV conduction block. Similar cardiovascular effects are not anticipated in humans because only trace amounts of the 2-N-methyl metabolite (<0.6% of lamotrigine dose) have been found in human urine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . However, it is conceivable that plasma concentrations of this metabolite could be increased in patients with a reduced capacity to glucuronidate lamotrigine (e.g., in patients with liver disease, patients taking concomitant medications that inhibit glucuronidation).']","['12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine have been studied in subjects with epilepsy, healthy young and elderly volunteers, and volunteers with chronic renal failure. Lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters for adult and pediatric subjects and healthy normal volunteers are summarized in Tables 14 and 16. Table 14. Mean Pharmacokinetic Parameters a in Healthy Volunteers and Adult Subjects with Epilepsy Adult Study Population Number of Subjects T max : Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (h) t ½ :Elimination Half-life (h) Cl/F: Apparent Plasma Clearance (mL/min/kg) Healthy volunteers taking no other medications: Single-dose lamotrigine 179 2.2 (0.25 to 2.0) 32.8 (14.0 to 103.0) 0.44 (0.12 to 1.10) Multiple-dose lamotrigine 36 1.7 (0.5 to 4.0) 25.4 (11.6 to 61.6) 0.58 (0.24 to 1.15) Healthy volunteers taking valproate: Single-dose lamotrigine 6 1.8 (1.0 to 4.0) 48.3 (31.5 to 88.6) 0.30 (0.14 to 0.42) Multiple-dose lamotrigine 18 1.9 (0.5 to 3.5) 70.3 (41.9 to 113.5) 0.18 (0.12 to 0.33) Subjects with epilepsy taking valproate only: Single-dose lamotrigine 4 4.8 (1.8 to 8.4) 58.8 (30.5 to 88.8) 0.28 (0.16 to 0.40) Subjects with epilepsy taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone b plus valproate: Single-dose lamotrigine 25 3.8 (1.0 to 10.0) 27.2 (11.2 to 51.6) 0.53 (0.27 to 1.04) Subjects with epilepsy taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone: b Single-dose lamotrigine 24 2.3 (0.5 to 5.0) 14.4 (6.4 to 30.4) 1.10 (0.51 to 2.22) Multiple-dose lamotrigine 17 2.0 (0.75 to 5.93) 12.6 (7.5 to 23.1) 1.21 (0.66 to 1.82) a The majority of parameter means determined in each study had coefficients of variation between 20% and 40% for half-life and CL/F and between 30% and 70% for T max. The overall mean values were calculated from individual study means that were weighted based on the number of volunteers/subjects in each study. The numbers in parentheses below each parameter mean represent the range of individual volunteer/subject values across studies. b Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone have been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and other drugs, such as rifampin and protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir, that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation have also been shown to increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Absorption Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass metabolism (absolute bioavailability is 98%). The bioavailability is not affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations occur anywhere from 1.4 to 4.8 hours following drug administration. The lamotrigine chewable/dispersible tablets were found to be equivalent whether administered as dispersed in water, chewed and swallowed, or swallowed whole, to the lamotrigine compressed tablets in terms of rate and extent of absorption. In terms of rate and extent of absorption, lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets, whether disintegrated in the mouth or swallowed whole with water, were equivalent to the lamotrigine compressed tablets swallowed with water. Dose Proportionality In healthy volunteers not receiving any other medications and given single doses, the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine increased in direct proportion to the dose administered over the range of 50 to 400 mg. In 2 small studies (n = 7 and 8) of patients with epilepsy who were maintained on other AEDs, there also was a linear relationship between dose and lamotrigine plasma concentrations at steady-state following doses of 50 to 350 mg twice daily. Distribution Estimates of the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of lamotrigine following oral administration ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. Vd/F is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers. Protein Binding Data from in vitro studies indicate that lamotrigine is approximately 55% bound to human plasma proteins at plasma lamotrigine concentrations from 1 to 10 mcg/mL (10 mcg/mL is 4 to 6 times the trough plasma concentration observed in the controlled efficacy trials). Because lamotrigine is not highly bound to plasma proteins, clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely. The binding of lamotrigine to plasma proteins did not change in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate. Lamotrigine did not displace other AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) from protein-binding sites. Metabolism Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation; the major metabolite is an inactive 2-N-glucuronide conjugate. After oral administration of 240 mg of 14 C-lamotrigine (15 μCi) to 6 healthy volunteers, 94% was recovered in the urine and 2% was recovered in the feces. The radioactivity in the urine consisted of unchanged lamotrigine (10%), the 2-N-glucuronide (76%), a 5-N-glucuronide (10%), a 2-N-methyl metabolite (0.14%), and other unidentified minor metabolites (4%). Enzyme Induction The effects of lamotrigine on the induction of specific families of mixed-function oxidase isozymes have not been systematically evaluated. Following multiple administrations (150 mg twice daily) to normal volunteers taking no other medications, lamotrigine induced its own metabolism, resulting in a 25% decrease in t ½ and a 37% increase in CL/F at steady-state compared with values obtained in the same volunteers following a single dose. Evidence gathered from other sources suggests that self-induction by lamotrigine may not occur when lamotrigine is given as adjunctive therapy in patients receiving enzyme-inducing drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Elimination The elimination half-life and apparent clearance of lamotrigine following oral administration of lamotrigine to adult subjects with epilepsy and healthy volunteers is summarized in Table 14. Half-life and apparent oral clearance vary depending on concomitant AEDs. Drug Interactions The apparent clearance of lamotrigine is affected by the coadministration of certain medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.12), Drug Interactions (7)]. The net effects of drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in Tables 13 and 15, followed by details of the drug interaction studies below. Table 15.

Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives In 16 female volunteers, an oral contraceptive preparation containing 30 mcg ethinylestradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel increased the apparent clearance of lamotrigine (300 mg/day) by approximately 2-fold with mean decreases in AUC of 52% and in C max of 39%. In this study, trough serum lamotrigine concentrations gradually increased and were approximately 2-fold higher on average at the end of the week of the inactive hormone preparation compared with trough lamotrigine concentrations at the end of the active hormone cycle. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels (approximate 2-fold increase) occurred during the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) for women not also taking a drug that increased the clearance of lamotrigine (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The increase in lamotrigine plasma levels will be greater if the dose of lamotrigine is increased in the few days before or during the pill-free week. Increases in lamotrigine plasma levels could result in dose-dependent adverse reactions. In the same study, coadministration of lamotrigine (300 mg/day) in 16 female volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the ethinylestradiol component of the oral contraceptive preparation. There were mean decreases in the AUC and C max of the levonorgestrel component of 19% and 12%, respectively. Measurement of serum progesterone indicated that there was no hormonal evidence of ovulation in any of the 16 volunteers, although measurement of serum FSH, LH, and estradiol indicated that there was some loss of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The effects of doses of lamotrigine other than 300 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The clinical significance of the observed hormonal changes on ovulatory activity is unknown. However, the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy in some patients cannot be excluded. Therefore, patients should be instructed to promptly report changes in their menstrual pattern (e.g., break-through bleeding). Dosage adjustments may be necessary for women receiving estrogen-containing oral contraceptive preparations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Other Hormonal Contraceptives or Hormone Replacement Therapy The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed. Aripiprazole In 18 patients with bipolar disorder on a stable regimen of 100 to 400 mg/day of lamotrigine, the lamotrigine AUC and C max were reduced by approximately 10% in patients who received aripiprazole 10 to 30 mg/day for 7 days, followed by 30 mg/day for an additional 7 days. This reduction in lamotrigine exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. Atazanavir/Ritonavir In a study in healthy volunteers, daily doses of atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg) reduced the plasma AUC and C max of lamotrigine (single 100-mg dose) by an average of 32% and 6%, respectively, and shortened the elimination half-lives by 27%. In the presence of atazanavir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg), the metabolite-to-lamotrigine ratio was increased from 0.45 to 0.71 consistent with induction of glucuronidation. The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir/ritonavir were similar in the presence of concomitant lamotrigine to the historical data of the pharmacokinetics in the absence of lamotrigine. Bupropion The pharmacokinetics of a 100-mg single dose of lamotrigine in healthy volunteers (n = 12) were not changed by coadministration of bupropion sustained-release formulation (150 mg twice daily) starting 11 days before lamotrigine. Carbamazepine Lamotrigine has no appreciable effect on steady-state carbamazepine plasma concentration. Limited clinical data suggest there is a higher incidence of dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The mechanism of this interaction is unclear. The effect of lamotrigine on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine-epoxide is unclear. In a small subset of patients (n = 7) studied in a placebo-controlled trial, lamotrigine had no effect on carbamazepine-epoxide plasma concentrations, but in a small, uncontrolled study (n = 9), carbamazepine-epoxide levels increased. The addition of carbamazepine decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. Felbamate In a trial in 21 healthy volunteers, coadministration of felbamate (1,200 mg twice daily) with lamotrigine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) appeared to have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. Folate Inhibitors Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. Prescribers should be aware of this action when prescribing other medications that inhibit folate metabolism. Gabapentin Based on a retrospective analysis of plasma levels in 34 subjects who received lamotrigine both with and without gabapentin, gabapentin does not appear to change the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Lacosamide Plasma concentrations of lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant lacosamide (200, 400, or 600 mg/day) in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with partial-onset seizures. Levetiracetam Potential drug interactions between levetiracetam and lamotrigine were assessed by evaluating serum concentrations of both agents during placebo-controlled clinical trials. These data indicate that lamotrigine does not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and that levetiracetam does not influence the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. Lithium The pharmacokinetics of lithium were not altered in healthy subjects (n = 20) by coadministration of lamotrigine (100 mg/day) for 6 days. Lopinavir/Ritonavir The addition of lopinavir (400 mg twice daily)/ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) decreased the AUC, C max , and elimination half-life of lamotrigine by approximately 50% to 55.4% in 18 healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir were similar with concomitant lamotrigine, compared with that in historical controls. Olanzapine The AUC and C max of olanzapine were similar following the addition of olanzapine (15 mg once daily) to lamotrigine (200 mg once daily) in healthy male volunteers (n = 16) compared with the AUC and C max in healthy male volunteers receiving olanzapine alone (n = 16). In the same trial, the AUC and C max of lamotrigine were reduced on average by 24% and 20%, respectively, following the addition of olanzapine to lamotrigine in healthy male volunteers compared with those receiving lamotrigine alone. This reduction in lamotrigine plasma concentrations is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Oxcarbazepine The AUC and C max of oxcarbazepine and its active 10-monohydroxy oxcarbazepine metabolite were not significantly different following the addition of oxcarbazepine (600 mg twice daily) to lamotrigine (200 mg once daily) in healthy male volunteers (n = 13) compared with healthy male volunteers receiving oxcarbazepine alone (n = 13). In the same trial, the AUC and C max of lamotrigine were similar following the addition of oxcarbazepine (600 mg twice daily) to lamotrigine in healthy male volunteers compared with those receiving lamotrigine alone. Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of headache, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence with coadministration of lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine compared with lamotrigine alone or oxcarbazepine alone. Perampanel In a pooled analysis of data from 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating adjunctive perampanel in patients with partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the highest perampanel dose evaluated (12 mg/day) increased lamotrigine clearance by <10%. An effect of this magnitude is not considered to be clinically relevant. Phenobarbital, Primidone The addition of phenobarbital or primidone decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. Phenytoin Lamotrigine has no appreciable effect on steady-state phenytoin plasma concentrations in patients with epilepsy. The addition of phenytoin decreases lamotrigine steady-state concentrations by approximately 40%. Pregabalin Steady-state trough plasma concentrations of lamotrigine were not affected by concomitant pregabalin (200 mg 3 times daily) administration. There are no pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and pregabalin. Rifampin In 10 male volunteers, rifampin (600 mg/day for 5 days) significantly increased the apparent clearance of a single 25-mg dose of lamotrigine by approximately 2-fold (AUC decreased by approximately 40%). Risperidone In a 14 healthy volunteers study, multiple oral doses of lamotrigine 400 mg daily had no clinically significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of risperidone 2 mg and its active metabolite 9-OH risperidone. Following the coadministration of risperidone 2 mg with lamotrigine, 12 of the 14 volunteers reported somnolence compared with 1 out of 20 when risperidone was given alone, and none when lamotrigine was administered alone. Topiramate Topiramate resulted in no change in plasma concentrations of lamotrigine. Administration of lamotrigine resulted in a 15% increase in topiramate concentrations. Valproate When lamotrigine was administered to healthy volunteers (n = 18) receiving valproate, the trough steady-state valproate plasma concentrations decreased by an average of 25% over a 3-week period, and then stabilized. However, adding lamotrigine to the existing therapy did not cause a change in valproate plasma concentrations in either adult or pediatric patients in controlled clinical trials. The addition of valproate increased lamotrigine steady-state concentrations in normal volunteers by slightly more than 2-fold. In 1 trial, maximal inhibition of lamotrigine clearance was reached at valproate doses between 250 and 500 mg/day and did not increase as the valproate dose was further increased. Zonisamide In a study in 18 patients with epilepsy, coadministration of zonisamide (200 to 400 mg/day) with lamotrigine (150 to 500 mg/day for 35 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine. Known Inducers or Inhibitors of Glucuronidation Drugs other than those listed above have not been systematically evaluated in combination with lamotrigine. Since lamotrigine is metabolized predominately by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine and doses of lamotrigine may require adjustment based on clinical response. Other In vitro assessment of the inhibitory effect of lamotrigine at OCT2 demonstrate that lamotrigine, but not the N(2)-glucuronide metabolite, is an inhibitor of OCT2 at potentially clinically relevant concentrations, with IC 50 value of 53.8 μM [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Results of in vitro experiments suggest that clearance of lamotrigine is unlikely to be reduced by concomitant administration of amitriptyline, clonazepam, clozapine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, lorazepam, phenelzine, sertraline, or trazodone. Results of in vitro experiments suggest that lamotrigine does not reduce the clearance of drugs eliminated predominantly by CYP2D6. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment : Twelve volunteers with chronic renal failure (mean creatinine clearance: 13 mL/min, range: 6 to 23) and another 6 individuals undergoing hemodialysis were each given a single 100-mg dose of lamotrigine. The mean plasma half-lives determined in the study were 42.9 hours (chronic renal failure), 13.0 hours (during hemodialysis), and 57.4 hours (between hemodialysis) compared with 26.2 hours in healthy volunteers. On average, approximately 20% (range: 5.6 to 35.1) of the amount of lamotrigine present in the body was eliminated by hemodialysis during a 4-hour session [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 100-mg dose of lamotrigine were evaluated in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification system) and compared with 12 subjects without hepatic impairment. The subjects with severe hepatic impairment were without ascites (n = 2) or with ascites (n = 5). The mean apparent clearances of lamotrigine in subjects with mild (n = 12), moderate (n = 5), severe without ascites (n = 2), and severe with ascites (n = 5) liver impairment were 0.30 ± 0.09, 0.24 ± 0.1, 0.21 ± 0.04, and 0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg, respectively, as compared with 0.37 ± 0.1 mL/min/kg in the healthy controls. Mean half-lives of lamotrigine in subjects with mild, moderate, severe without ascites, and severe with ascites hepatic impairment were 46 ± 20, 72 ± 44, 67 ± 11, and 100 ± 48 hours, respectively, as compared with 33 ± 7 hours in healthy controls [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Pediatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 2-mg/kg dose were evaluated in 2 studies in pediatric subjects (n = 29 for subjects aged 10 months to 5.9 years and n = 26 for subjects aged 5 to 11 years). Forty-three subjects received concomitant therapy with other AEDs and 12 subjects received lamotrigine as monotherapy. Lamotrigine pharmacokinetic parameters for pediatric patients are summarized in Table 16. Population pharmacokinetic analyses involving subjects aged 2 to 18 years demonstrated that lamotrigine clearance was influenced predominantly by total body weight and concurrent AED therapy. The oral clearance of lamotrigine was higher, on a body weight basis, in pediatric patients than in adults. Weight-normalized lamotrigine clearance was higher in those subjects weighing < 30 kg compared with those weighing >30 kg. Accordingly, patients weighing < 30 kg may need an increase of as much as 50% in maintenance doses, based on clinical response, as compared with subjects weighing > 30 kg being administered the same AEDs [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . These analyses also revealed that, after accounting for body weight, lamotrigine clearance was not significantly influenced by age. Thus, the same weight-adjusted doses should be administered to children irrespective of differences in age. Concomitant AEDs which influence lamotrigine clearance in adults were found to have similar effects in children. Table 16.

Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine following a single 150-mg dose of lamotrigine were evaluated in 12 elderly volunteers between the ages of 65 and 76 years (mean creatinine clearance = 61 mL/min, range: 33 to 108 mL/min). The mean half-life of lamotrigine in these subjects was 31.2 hours (range: 24.5 to 43.4 hours), and the mean clearance was 0.40 mL/min/kg (range: 0.26 to 0.48 mL/min/kg). Male and Female Patients : The clearance of lamotrigine is not affected by gender. However, during dose escalation of lamotrigine in 1 clinical trial in patients with epilepsy on a stable dose of valproate (n = 77), mean trough lamotrigine concentrations unadjusted for weight were 24% to 45% higher (0.3 to 1.7 mcg/mL) in females than in males. Racial or Ethnic Groups : The apparent oral clearance of lamotrigine was 25% lower in non-Caucasians than Caucasians.']","['13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in mice or rats following oral administration of lamotrigine for up to 2 years at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, respectively.

The patients experienced at least 4 simple partial-onset, complex partial-onset, and/or secondarily generalized seizures during each of 2 consecutive 4-week periods while receiving carbamazepine or phenytoin monotherapy during baseline. Lamotrigine (target dose of 500 mg/day) or valproate (1,000 mg/day) was added to either carbamazepine or phenytoin monotherapy over a 4-week period. Patients were then converted to monotherapy with lamotrigine or valproate during the next 4 weeks, then continued on monotherapy for an additional 12-week period. Trial endpoints were completion of all weeks of trial treatment or meeting an escape criterion. Criteria for escape relative to baseline were: (1) doubling of average monthly seizure count, (2) doubling of highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency, (3) emergence of a new seizure type (defined as a seizure that did not occur during the 8-week baseline) that is more severe than seizure types that occur during study treatment, or (4) clinically significant prolongation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients in each treatment group who met escape criteria. The percentages of patients who met escape criteria were 42% (32/76) in the group receiving lamotrigine and 69% (55/80) in the valproate group. The difference in the percentage of patients meeting escape criteria was statistically significant ( P = 0.0012) in favor of lamotrigine. No differences in efficacy based on age, sex, or race were detected. Patients in the control group were intentionally treated with a relatively low dose of valproate; as such, the sole objective of this trial was to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy with lamotrigine, and cannot be interpreted to imply the superiority of lamotrigine to an adequate dose of valproate. Adjunctive Therapy with Lamotrigine in Adults with Partial-Onset Seizures The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy (added to other AEDs) was initially established in 3 pivotal, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials in 355 adults with refractory partial-onset seizures. The patients had a history of at least 4 partial-onset seizures per month in spite of receiving 1 or more AEDs at therapeutic concentrations and in 2 of the trials were observed on their established AED regimen during baselines that varied between 8 to 12 weeks. In the third trial, patients were not observed in a prospective baseline. In patients continuing to have at least 4 seizures per month during the baseline, lamotrigine or placebo was then added to the existing therapy. In all 3 trials, change from baseline in seizure frequency was the primary measure of effectiveness. The results given below are for all partial-onset seizures in the intent-to-treat population (all patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment) in each trial, unless otherwise indicated. The median seizure frequency at baseline was 3 per week while the mean at baseline was 6.6 per week for all patients enrolled in efficacy trials. One trial (n = 216) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial consisting of a 24-week treatment period. Patients could not be on more than 2 other anticonvulsants and valproate was not allowed. Patients were randomized to receive placebo, a target dose of 300 mg/day of lamotrigine, or a target dose of 500 mg/day of lamotrigine. The median reductions in the frequency of all partial-onset seizures relative to baseline were 8% in patients receiving placebo, 20% in patients receiving 300 mg/day of lamotrigine, and 36% in patients receiving 500 mg/day of lamotrigine. The seizure frequency reduction was statistically significant in the 500-mg/day group compared with the placebo group, but not in the 300-mg/day group. A second trial (n = 98) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 14-week treatment periods (the last 2 weeks of which consisted of dose tapering) separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients could not be on more than 2 other anticonvulsants and valproate was not allowed. The target dose of lamotrigine was 400 mg/day. When the first 12 weeks of the treatment periods were analyzed, the median change in seizure frequency was a 25% reduction on lamotrigine compared with placebo ( P <0.001). The third trial (n = 41) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial consisting of two 12-week treatment periods separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients could not be on more than 2 other anticonvulsants. Thirteen patients were on concomitant valproate; these patients received 150 mg/day of lamotrigine. The 28 other patients had a target dose of 300 mg/day of lamotrigine. The median change in seizure frequency was a 26% reduction on lamotrigine compared with placebo ( P <0.01). No differences in efficacy based on age, sex, or race, as measured by change in seizure frequency, were detected. Adjunctive Therapy with Lamotrigine in Pediatric Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 199 patients aged 2 to 16 years (n = 98 on lamotrigine, n = 101 on placebo). Following an 8-week baseline phase, patients were randomized to 18 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 2 drugs. Patients were dosed based on body weight and valproate use. Target doses were designed to approximate 5 mg/kg/day for patients taking valproate (maximum dose: 250 mg/day) and 15 mg/kg/day for the patients not taking valproate (maximum dose: 750 mg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in all partial-onset seizures. For the intent-to-treat population, the median reduction of all partial-onset seizures was 36% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 7% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant ( P <0.01). Adjunctive Therapy with Lamotrigine in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 169 patients aged 3 to 25 years (n = 79 on lamotrigine, n = 90 on placebo). Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo phase, patients were randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 3 drugs. Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen based on body weight and valproate use. Target doses were designed to approximate 5 mg/kg/day for patients taking valproate (maximum dose: 200 mg/day) and 15 mg/kg/day for patients not taking valproate (maximum dose: 400 mg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in major motor seizures (atonic, tonic, major myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures). For the intent-to-treat population, the median reduction of major motor seizures was 32% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 9% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant ( P <0.05). Drop attacks were significantly reduced by lamotrigine (34%) compared with placebo (9%), as were tonic-clonic seizures (36% reduction versus 10% increase for lamotrigine and placebo, respectively). Adjunctive Therapy with Lamotrigine in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with PGTC seizures was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 117 pediatric and adult patients aged 2 years and older (n = 58 on lamotrigine, n = 59 on placebo). Patients with at least 3 PGTC seizures during an 8-week baseline phase were randomized to 19 to 24 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 2 drugs. Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen, with target doses ranging from 3 to 12 mg/kg/day for pediatric patients and from 200 to 400 mg/day for adult patients based on concomitant AEDs. The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in PGTC seizures. For the intent-to-treat population, the median percent reduction in PGTC seizures was 66% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 34% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant ( P = 0.006). 14.2 Bipolar Disorder Adults The effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in Trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year). In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of lamotrigine as add-on therapy or as monotherapy with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of lamotrigine. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with lamotrigine, were randomized to a placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode. In Trial 1, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine 50 mg/day (n = 50), lamotrigine 200 mg/day (n = 124), lamotrigine 400 mg/day (n = 47), or placebo (n = 121). Lamotrigine (200- and 400-mg/day treatment groups combined) was superior to placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 1). Separate analyses of the 200- and 400-mg/day dose groups revealed no added benefit from the higher dose. In Trial 2, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day, n = 59), or placebo (n = 70). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo in delaying time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 2). The mean dose of lamotrigine was about 211 mg/day. Although these trials were not designed to separately evaluate time to the occurrence of depression or mania, a combined analysis for the 2 trials revealed a statistically significant benefit for lamotrigine over placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of both depression and mania, although the finding was more robust for depression.

Rash Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, inform patients that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and instruct them to report any such occurrence to their healthcare providers immediately. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, inform patients that excessive immune activation may occur with lamotrigine and that they should report signs or symptoms such as fever, rash, or lymphadenopathy to a healthcare provider immediately. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions, Blood Dyscrasias, and Organ Failure Inform patients that multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions and acute multiorgan failure may occur with lamotrigine. Isolated organ failure or isolated blood dyscrasias without evidence of multiorgan hypersensitivity may also occur. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare providers immediately if they experience any signs or symptoms of these conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)]. Suicidal Thinking and Behavior Inform patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including lamotrigine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Instruct them to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts or behavior or thoughts about self-harm. Instruct them to immediately report behaviors of concern to their healthcare providers. Worsening of Seizures Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers if worsening of seizure control occurs. Central Nervous System Adverse Effects Inform patients that lamotrigine may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms and signs of central nervous system depression. Accordingly, instruct them neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on lamotrigine to gauge whether or not it adversely affects their mental and/or motor performance. Pregnancy and Nursing Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy and if they intend to breastfeed or are breastfeeding an infant. Encourage patients to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Inform patients who intend to breastfeed that lamotrigine is present in breast milk and advise them to monitor their child for potential adverse effects of this drug. Discuss the benefits and risks of continuing breastfeeding. Oral Contraceptive Use Instruct women to notify their healthcare providers if they plan to start or stop use of oral contraceptives or other female hormonal preparations. Starting estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may significantly decrease lamotrigine plasma levels and stopping estrogen-containing oral contraceptives (including the pill-free week) may significantly increase lamotrigine plasma levels [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Also instruct women to promptly notify their healthcare providers if they experience adverse reactions or changes in menstrual pattern (e.g., break-through bleeding) while receiving lamotrigine in combination with these medications. Discontinuing Lamotrigine Instructpatients to notify their healthcare providers if they stop taking lamotrigine for any reason and not to resume lamotrigine without consulting their healthcare providers. Aseptic Meningitis Inform patients that lamotrigine may cause aseptic meningitis. Instruct them to notify their healthcare providers immediately if they develop signs and symptoms of meningitis such as headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, rash, abnormal sensitivity to light, myalgia, chills, confusion, or drowsiness while taking lamotrigine. Potential Medication Errors To avoid a medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, strongly advise patients to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine, as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription [see Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3.3), How Supplied/Storage And Handling (16)] .

The incidence of these rashes, which have included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is approximately 0.3% to 0.8% in pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years) and 0.08% to 0.3% in adults receiving lamotrigine. One rash-related death was reported in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or rash-related death have been reported in adult and pediatric patients, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate. Other than age, there are as yet no factors identified that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of rash caused by lamotrigine. There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of rash may also be increased by (1) coadministration of lamotrigine with valproate (includes valproic acid and divalproex sodium), (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors. Nearly all cases of life-threatening rashes caused by lamotrigine have occurred within 2 to 8 weeks of treatment initiation. However, isolated cases have occurred after prolonged treatment (e.g., 6 months). Accordingly, duration of therapy cannot be relied upon as means to predict the potential risk heralded by the first appearance of a rash. Although benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine, it is not possible to predict reliably which rashes will prove to be serious or life threatening. Accordingly, lamotrigine should ordinarily be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Discontinuation of treatment may not prevent a rash from becoming life threatening or permanently disabling or disfiguring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . WARNING: SERIOUS SKIN RASHES See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Cases of life-threatening serious rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and/or rash-related death have been caused by lamotrigine. The rate of serious rash is greater in pediatric patients than in adults. Additional factors that may increase the risk of rash include: coadministration with valproate. exceeding recommended initial dose of lamotrigine. exceeding recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine. (5.1) Benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine; however, it is not possible to predict which rashes will prove to be serious or life threatening. Lamotrigine should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related.

Overdose has resulted in ataxia, nystagmus, seizures (including tonic-clonic seizures), decreased level of consciousness, coma, and intraventricular conduction delay. 10.2 Management of Overdose There are no specific antidotes for lamotrigine. Following a suspected overdose, hospitalization of the patient is advised. General supportive care is indicated, including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient. If indicated, emesis should be induced; usual precautions should be taken to protect the airway. It should be kept in mind that immediate-release lamotrigine is rapidly absorbed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is uncertain whether hemodialysis is an effective means of removing lamotrigine from the blood. In 6 renal failure patients, about 20% of the amount of lamotrigine in the body was removed by hemodialysis during a 4-hour session. A Poison Control Center should be contacted for information on the management of overdosage of lamotrigine.']","['MEDICATION GUIDE Lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets (lă-mō’trī-jēn) What is the most important information I should know about lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets? 1. Lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets may cause a serious skin rash that may cause you to be hospitalized or even cause death. There is no way to tell if a mild rash will become more serious. A serious skin rash can happen at any time during your treatment with lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets, but is more likely to happen within the first 2 to 8 weeks of treatment. Children and teenagers aged between 2 and 17 years have a higher chance of getting this serious skin rash while taking lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets. The risk of getting a serious skin rash is higher if you: take lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets while taking valproate [DEPAKENE (valproic acid) or DEPAKOTE (divalproex sodium)]. take a higher starting dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets than your healthcare provider prescribed. increase your dose of lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets faster than prescribed. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following: a skin rash blistering or peeling of your skin hives painful sores in your mouth or around your eyes These symptoms may be the first signs of a serious skin reaction. A healthcare provider should examine you to decide if you should continue taking lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets. 2. Other serious reactions, including serious blood problems or liver problems. Lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets can also cause other types of allergic reactions or serious problems that may affect organs and other parts of your body like your liver or blood cells. You may or may not have a rash with these types of reactions. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: fever frequent infections severe muscle pain swelling of your face, eyes, lips, or tongue swollen lymph glands unusual bruising or bleeding weakness, fatigue yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes 3. Like other antiepileptic drugs, lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempt to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood Do not stop lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines.

The efficacy of BRINTELLIX was established in six 6 to 8 week studies (including one study in the elderly) and one maintenance study in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .']","['2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals ( 2.1 ). • The dose should then be increased to 20 mg/day, as tolerated ( 2.1 ). • Consider 5 mg/day for patients who do not tolerate higher doses ( 2.1 ). • BRINTELLIX can be discontinued abruptly. However, it is recommended that doses of 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day be reduced to 10 mg/day for one week prior to full discontinuation if possible ( 2.3 ). • The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg/day in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.6 ). 2.1 General Instruction for Use The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals. Dosage should then be increased to 20 mg/day, as tolerated, because higher doses demonstrated better treatment effects in trials conducted in the United States. The efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mg/day have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. A dose decrease down to 5 mg/day may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 2.2 Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depression should be followed by several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. A maintenance study of BRINTELLIX demonstrated that BRINTELLIX decreased the risk of recurrence of depressive episodes compared to placebo. 2.3 Discontinuing Treatment Although BRINTELLIX can be abruptly discontinued, in placebo-controlled trials patients experienced transient adverse reactions such as headache and muscle tension following abrupt discontinuation of BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day. To avoid these adverse reactions, it is recommended that the dose be decreased to 10 mg/day for one week before full discontinuation of BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 2.4 Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with BRINTELLIX to avoid the risk of Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Conversely, at least 21 days should be allowed after stopping BRINTELLIX before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4) ]. 2.5 Use of BRINTELLIX with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue Do not start BRINTELLIX in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [see Contraindications (4) ] . In some cases, a patient already receiving BRINTELLIX therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, BRINTELLIX should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 21 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with BRINTELLIX may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with BRINTELLIX is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.6 Use of BRINTELLIX in Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers or in Patients Taking Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors The maximum recommended dose of BRINTELLIX is 10 mg/day in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Reduce the dose of BRINTELLIX by one-half when patients are receiving a CYP2D6 strong inhibitor (e.g., bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or quinidine) concomitantly. The dose should be increased to the original level when the CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . 2.7 Use of BRINTELLIX in Patients Taking Strong CYP Inducers Consider increasing the dose of BRINTELLIX when a strong CYP inducer (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, or phenytoin) is coadministered for greater than 14 days. The maximum recommended dose should not exceed three times the original dose. The dose of BRINTELLIX should be reduced to the original level within 14 days, when the inducer is discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] .']","['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS BRINTELLIX is available as immediate-release, film-coated tablets in the following strengths: • 5 mg: pink, almond shaped biconvex film coated tablet, debossed with ""5"" on one side and ""TL"" on the other side • 10 mg: yellow, almond shaped biconvex film coated tablet, debossed with ""10"" on one side and ""TL"" on the other side • 15 mg: orange, almond shaped biconvex film coated tablet, debossed with ""15"" on one side and ""TL"" on the other side • 20 mg: red, almond shaped biconvex film coated tablet, debossed with ""20"" on one side and ""TL"" on the other side BRINTELLIX is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg immediate release tablets ( 3 ).']","['4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to vortioxetine or any components of the formulation. Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with BRINTELLIX. • The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with BRINTELLIX or within 21 days of stopping treatment with BRINTELLIX is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of BRINTELLIX within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Starting BRINTELLIX in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . • Hypersensitivity to vortioxetine or any components of the BRINTELLIX formulation ( 4 ). • Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with BRINTELLIX or within 21 days of stopping treatment with BRINTELLIX. Do not use BRINTELLIX within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. In addition, do not start BRINTELLIX in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue ( 4 ).']","[""5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serotonin Syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, and others), including with BRINTELLIX, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort). If such symptoms occur, discontinue BRINTELLIX and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases ( 5.2 ). • Treatment with serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, and others) may increase the risk of abnormal bleeding. Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation ( 5.3 ). • Activation of Mania/Hypomania can occur with antidepressant treatment. Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.4 ). • Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( 5.5 ). • Hyponatremia can occur in association with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) ( 5.6 ). 5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a trend toward reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term studies of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of two months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1 . Table 1. Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Age Range Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that BRINTELLIX is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants including BRINTELLIX, when used alone but more often when used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. BRINTELLIX should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking BRINTELLIX. BRINTELLIX should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4) and Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . If concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with BRINTELLIX and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. 5.3 Abnormal Bleeding The use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including BRINTELLIX, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.4 Activation of Mania/Hypomania Symptoms of mania/hypomania were reported in <0.1% of patients treated with BRINTELLIX in pre-marketing clinical studies. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, use BRINTELLIX cautiously in patients with a history or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.5 Angle Closure Glaucoma Angle Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including BRINTELLIX, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. 5.6 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia has occurred as a result of treatment with serotonergic drugs. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). One case with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L was reported in a subject treated with BRINTELLIX in a pre-marketing clinical study. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted can be at greater risk. Discontinuation of BRINTELLIX in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.""]","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. • Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] • Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Abnormal Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Activation of Mania/Hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were: nausea, constipation and vomiting ( 6 ).

Patient Exposure BRINTELLIX was evaluated for safety in 4746 patients (18 years to 88 years of age) diagnosed with MDD who participated in pre-marketing clinical studies; 2616 of those patients were exposed to BRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week, placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg once daily and 204 patients were exposed to BRINTELLIX in a 24 week to 64 week placebo-controlled maintenance study at doses of 5 mg to 10 mg once daily. Patients from the 6 to 8 week studies continued into 12‑month open-label studies. A total of 2586 patients were exposed to at least one dose of BRINTELLIX in open-label studies, 1727 were exposed to BRINTELLIX for six months and 885 were exposed for at least one year. Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment In pooled 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies the incidence of patients who received BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day and discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction was 5%, 6%, 8% and 8%, respectively, compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. Nausea was the most common adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation. Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled MDD Studies The most commonly observed adverse reactions in MDD patients treated with BRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were nausea, constipation and vomiting. Table 2 shows the incidence of common adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of MDD patients treated with any BRINTELLIX dose and at least 2% more frequently than in placebo-treated patients in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. Table 2.

It was usually considered mild or moderate in intensity and the median duration was 2 weeks. Nausea was more common in females than males. Nausea most commonly occurred in the first week of BRINTELLIX treatment with 15 to 20% of patients experiencing nausea after 1 to 2 days of treatment. Approximately 10% of patients taking BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day had nausea at the end of the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. Sexual Dysfunction Difficulties in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of psychiatric disorders, but they may also be consequences of pharmacologic treatment. In the MDD 6 to 8 week controlled trials of BRINTELLIX, voluntarily reported adverse reactions related to sexual dysfunction were captured as individual event terms. These event terms have been aggregated and the overall incidence was as follows. In male patients the overall incidence was 3%, 4%, 4%, 5% in BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day, respectively, compared to 2% in placebo. In female patients, the overall incidence was <1%, 1%, <1%, 2% in BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day, respectively, compared to <1% in placebo. Because voluntarily reported adverse sexual reactions are known to be underreported, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them, the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), a validated measure designed to identify sexual side effects, was used prospectively in seven placebo-controlled trials. The ASEX scale includes five questions that pertain to the following aspects of sexual function: 1) sex drive, 2) ease of arousal, 3) ability to achieve erection (men) or lubrication (women), 4) ease of reaching orgasm, and 5) orgasm satisfaction. The presence or absence of sexual dysfunction among patients entering clinical studies was based on their ASEX scores. For patients without sexual dysfunction at baseline (approximately 1/3 of the population across all treatment groups in each study), Table 3 shows the incidence of patients that developed treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction when treated with BRINTELLIX or placebo in any fixed dose group. Physicians should routinely inquire about possible sexual side effects. Table 3. ASEX Incidence of Treatment Emergent Sexual Dysfunction Incidence based on number of subjects with sexual dysfunction during the study / number of subjects without sexual dysfunction at baseline. Sexual dysfunction was defined as a subject scoring any of the following on the ASEX scale at two consecutive visits during the study: 1) total score ≥19; 2) any single item ≥5; 3) three or more items each with a score ≥4 BRINTELLIX 5 mg/day N=65:67 Sample size for each dose group is the number of patients (females:males) without sexual dysfunction at baseline BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day N=94:86 BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day N=57:67 BRINTELLIX 20 mg/day N=67:59 Placebo N=135:162 Females 22% 23% 33% 34% 20% Males 16% 20% 19% 29% 14% Adverse Reactions Following Abrupt Discontinuation of BRINTELLIX Treatment Discontinuation symptoms have been prospectively evaluated in patients taking BRINTELLIX 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, and 20 mg/day using the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) scale in clinical trials. Some patients experienced discontinuation symptoms such as headache, muscle tension, mood swings, sudden outbursts of anger, dizziness, and runny nose in the first week of abrupt discontinuation of BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day. Laboratory Tests BRINTELLIX has not been associated with any clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters in serum chemistry (except sodium), hematology and urinalysis as measured in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. Hyponatremia has been reported with the treatment of BRINTELLIX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . In the 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a long-term study in patients who had responded to BRINTELLIX during the initial 12-week, open-label phase, there were no clinically important changes in lab test parameters between BRINTELLIX and placebo-treated patients. Weight BRINTELLIX had no significant effect on body weight as measured by the mean change from baseline in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. In the 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a long-term study in patients who had responded to BRINTELLIX during the initial 12-week, open-label phase, there was no significant effect on body weight between BRINTELLIX and placebo-treated patients. Vital Signs BRINTELLIX has not been associated with any clinically significant effects on vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, as measured in placebo-controlled studies. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies The following listing does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.

The maximum recommended dose should not exceed 3 times the original dose ( 2.7 and 7.3 ). 7.1 CNS Active Agents Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Adverse reactions, some of which are serious or fatal, can develop in patients who use MAOIs or who have recently been discontinued from an MAOI and started on a serotonergic antidepressant(s) or who have recently had SSRI or SNRI therapy discontinued prior to initiation of an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of BRINTELLIX and the potential for serotonin toxicity, serotonin syndrome may occur when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, buspirone, tramadol, and tryptophan products etc.). Closely monitor symptoms of serotonin syndrome if BRINTELLIX is co-administered with other serotonergic drugs. Treatment with BRINTELLIX and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if serotonin syndrome occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Other CNS Active Agents No clinically relevant effect was observed on steady state lithium exposure following coadministration with multiple daily doses of BRINTELLIX. Multiple doses of BRINTELLIX did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (composite cognitive score) of diazepam. A clinical study has shown that BRINTELLIX (single dose of 20 or 40 mg) did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol (single dose of 0.6 g/kg). Details on the potential pharmacokinetic interactions between BRINTELLIX and bupropion can be found in Section 7.3 . 7.2 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin) Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Following coadministration of stable doses of warfarin (1 to 10 mg/day) with multiple daily doses of BRINTELLIX, no significant effects were observed in INR, prothrombin values or total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics for both R- and S-warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Coadministration of aspirin 150 mg/day with multiple daily doses of BRINTELLIX had no significant inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation or pharmacokinetics of aspirin and salicylic acid [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Patients receiving other drugs that interfere with hemostasis should be carefully monitored when BRINTELLIX is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 7.3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect BRINTELLIX Reduce BRINTELLIX dose by half when a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) is coadministered. Consider increasing the BRINTELLIX dose when a strong CYP inducer (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is coadministered. The maximum dose is not recommended to exceed three times the original dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 and 2.6) ] (Figure 1). Figure 1. Impact of Other Drugs on Vortioxetine PK Figure1.jpg 7.4 Potential for BRINTELLIX to Affect Other Drugs No dose adjustment for the comedications is needed when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with a substrate of CYP1A2 (e.g., duloxetine), CYP2A6, CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropion), CYP2C8 (e.g., repaglinide), CYP2C9 (e.g., S-warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam), CYP2D6 (e.g., venlafaxine), CYP3A4/5 (e.g., budesonide), and P-gp (e.g., digoxin). In addition, no dose adjustment for lithium, aspirin, and warfarin is necessary. Vortioxetine and its metabolites are unlikely to inhibit the following CYP enzymes and transporter based on in vitro data: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, and P-gp. As such, no clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected. In addition, vortioxetine did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 in an in vitro study in cultured human hepatocytes. Chronic administration of BRINTELLIX is unlikely to induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by these CYP isoforms. Furthermore, in a series of clinical drug interaction studies, coadministration of BRINTELLIX with substrates for CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropion), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), and CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam), had no clinical meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of these substrates (Figure 2). Because vortioxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, coadministration of BRINTELLIX with another drug that is highly protein bound may increase free concentrations of the other drug. However, in a clinical study with coadministration of BRINTELLIX (10 mg/day) and warfarin (1 mg/day to 10 mg/day), a highly protein-bound drug, no significant change in INR was observed [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Figure 2. Impact of Vortioxetine on PK of Other Drugs Figure2.jpg']","['8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy: Based on animal data, BRINTELLIX may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ). • Nursing Mothers: Discontinue BRINTELLIX or nursing ( 8.3 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of BRINTELLIX in pregnant women. Vortioxetine caused developmental delays when administered during pregnancy to rats and rabbits at doses 15 and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg, respectively. Developmental delays were also seen after birth in rats at doses 20 times the MRHD of vortioxetine given during pregnancy and through lactation. There were no teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits at doses up to 77 and 58 times, the MRHD of vortioxetine, respectively, given during organogenesis. The incidence of malformations in human pregnancies has not been established for BRINTELLIX. All human pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. BRINTELLIX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Clinical Considerations Neonates exposed to SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of these classes of drugs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) ] . When treating a pregnant woman with BRINTELLIX during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment . Neonates exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in one to two per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several recent epidemiologic studies suggest a positive statistical association between SSRI use in pregnancy and PPHN. Other studies do not show a significant statistical association. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depression, who were either on antidepressants or had received antidepressants less than 12 weeks prior to their last menstrual period, and were in remission. Women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy showed a significant increase in relapse of their major depression compared to those women who remained on antidepressant medication throughout pregnancy. When treating a pregnant woman with BRINTELLIX, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks of taking a serotonergic antidepressant, along with the established benefits of treating depression with an antidepressant. Animal Data In pregnant rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were seen when vortioxetine was given during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 160 and 60 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are 77 and 58 times, in rats and rabbits, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Developmental delay, seen as decreased fetal body weight and delayed ossification, occurred in rats and rabbits at doses equal to and greater than 30 and 10 mg/kg (15 and 10 times the MRHD, respectively) in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain). When vortioxetine was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses up to 120 mg/kg (58 times the MRHD) throughout pregnancy and lactation, the number of live-born pups was decreased and early postnatal pup mortality was increased at 40 and 120 mg/kg. Additionally, pup weights were decreased at birth to weaning at 120 mg/kg and development (specifically eye opening) was slightly delayed at 40 and 120 mg/kg. These effects were not seen at 10 mg/kg (5 times the MRHD). 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether vortioxetine is present in human milk. Vortioxetine is present in the milk of lactating rats. Because many drugs are present in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from BRINTELLIX, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Clinical studies on the use of BRINTELLIX in pediatric patients have not been conducted; therefore, the safety and effectiveness of BRINTELLIX in the pediatric population have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended on the basis of age (Figure 3) . Results from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly (>65 years old) vs. young (24 to 45 years old) subjects demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics were generally similar between the two age groups. Of the 2616 subjects in clinical studies of BRINTELLIX, 11% (286) were 65 and over, which included subjects from a placebo-controlled study specifically in elderly patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Serotonergic antidepressants have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 8.6 Use in Other Patient Populations No dose adjustment of BRINTELLIX on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity, or renal function (from mild renal impairment to end-stage renal disease) is necessary. In addition, the same dose can be administered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Figure 3). BRINTELLIX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, BRINTELLIX is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Figure 3. Impact of Intrinsic Factors on Vortioxetine PK Figure3.jpg']","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of BRINTELLIX in pregnant women. Vortioxetine caused developmental delays when administered during pregnancy to rats and rabbits at doses 15 and 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg, respectively. Developmental delays were also seen after birth in rats at doses 20 times the MRHD of vortioxetine given during pregnancy and through lactation. There were no teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits at doses up to 77 and 58 times, the MRHD of vortioxetine, respectively, given during organogenesis. The incidence of malformations in human pregnancies has not been established for BRINTELLIX. All human pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. BRINTELLIX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Clinical Considerations Neonates exposed to SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of these classes of drugs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) ] . When treating a pregnant woman with BRINTELLIX during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment .

Vortioxetine HBr is known chemically as 1-[2-(2,4-Dimethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-phenyl]-piperazine, hydrobromide. The empirical formula is C 18 H 22 N 2 S, HBr with a molecular weight of 379.36 g/mol. The structural formula is: Vortioxetine HBr is a white to very slightly beige powder that is slightly soluble in water. Each BRINTELLIX tablet contains 6.355 mg, 12.71 mg, 19.065 mg, or 25.42 mg of vortioxetine HBr equivalent to 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 20 mg of vortioxetine, respectively. The inactive ingredients in BRINTELLIX tablets include mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate and film coating which consists of hypromellose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol 400, iron oxide red (5 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg) and iron oxide yellow (10 mg and 15 mg). chem structure.jpg']","[""12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of the antidepressant effect of vortioxetine is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). It also has several other activities including 5-HT3 receptor antagonism and 5-HT1A receptor agonism. The contribution of these activities to vortioxetine's antidepressant effect has not been established. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Vortioxetine binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter (Ki=1.6 nM), but not to the norepinephrine (Ki=113 nM) or dopamine (Ki>1000 nM) transporters. Vortioxetine potently and selectively inhibits reuptake of serotonin (IC50=5.4 nM). Vortioxetine binds to 5-HT3 (Ki=3.7 nM), 5-HT1A (Ki=15 nM), 5-HT7 (Ki=19 nM), 5-HT1D (Ki=54 nM), and 5-HT1B (Ki=33 nM), receptors and is a 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. In humans, the mean 5-HT transporter occupancy, based on the results from 2 clinical PET studies using 5-HTT ligands ([ 11 C]-MADAM or [ 11 C]-DASB), was approximately 50% at 5 mg/day, 65% at 10 mg/day and approximately 80% at 20 mg/day in the regions of interest. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of vortioxetine 10 mg and 40 mg administered once daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), four-treatment-arm parallel study in 340 male subjects. In the study the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the QTc was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. The oral dose of 40 mg is sufficient to assess the effect of metabolic inhibition. Effect on Driving Performance In a clinical study in healthy subjects, BRINTELLIX did not impair driving performance, or have adverse psychomotor or cognitive effects following single and multiple doses of 10 mg/day. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that BRINTELLIX therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Vortioxetine pharmacological activity is due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine (2.5 mg to 60 mg) are linear and dose-proportional when vortioxetine is administered once daily. The mean terminal half-life is approximately 66 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved within two weeks of dosing. Absorption The maximal plasma vortioxetine concentration (C max ) after dosing is reached within 7 to 11 hours postdose (T max ). Steady-state mean C max values were 9, 18, and 33 ng/mL following doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/day. Absolute bioavailability is 75%. No effect of food on the pharmacokinetics was observed. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of vortioxetine is approximately 2600 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. The plasma protein binding of vortioxetine in humans is 98%, independent of plasma concentrations. No apparent difference in the plasma protein binding between healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic (mild, moderate) or renal (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) impairment is observed. Metabolism and Elimination Vortioxetine is extensively metabolized primarily through oxidation via cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. CYP2D6 is the primary enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of vortioxetine to its major, pharmacologically inactive, carboxylic acid metabolite, and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 have approximately twice the vortioxetine plasma concentration of extensive metabolizers. Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C]-labeled vortioxetine, approximately 59% and 26% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively as metabolites. Negligible amounts of unchanged vortioxetine were excreted in the urine up to 48 hours. The presence of hepatic (mild or moderate) or renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe and ESRD) did not affect the apparent clearance of vortioxetine.""]","[""12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of the antidepressant effect of vortioxetine is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its enhancement of serotonergic activity in the CNS through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).

Adults (aged 18 years to 75 years) The efficacy of BRINTELLIX in patients aged 18 years to 75 years was demonstrated in five 6 to 8 week, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 to 5 in Table 4 ). In these studies, patients were randomized to BRINTELLIX 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg or placebo once daily. For patients who were randomized to BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day, the final doses were titrated up from 10 mg/day after the first week. The primary efficacy measures were the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) total score in Study 2 and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score in all other studies. In each of these studies, at least one dose group of BRINTELLIX was superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms as measured by mean change from baseline to endpoint visit on the primary efficacy measurement (see Table 4) . Subgroup analysis by age, gender or race did not suggest any clear evidence of differential responsiveness. Two studies of the 5 mg dose in the U.S. (not represented in Table 4) failed to show effectiveness. Elderly Study (aged 64 years to 88 years) The efficacy of BRINTELLIX for the treatment of MDD was also demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study of BRINTELLIX in elderly patients (aged 64 years to 88 years) with MDD (Study 6 in Table 4 ). Patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD with at least one previous major depressive episode before the age of 60 years and without comorbid cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination score <24) received BRINTELLIX 5 mg or placebo.

Approximately 61% of randomized patients satisfied remission criterion (MADRS total score ≤10) for at least 4 weeks (since Week 8), and 15% for at least 8 weeks (since Week 4). Patients on BRINTELLIX experienced a statistically significantly longer time to have recurrence of depressive episodes than did patients on placebo.

risks associated with treatment with BRINTELLIX and counsel them in its appropriate use. Advise patients and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and assist them in understanding its contents. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Suicide Risk Advise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, especially early during treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Discontinuation of Treatment Patients who are on BRINTELLIX 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day may experience headache, muscle tension, mood swings, sudden outburst of anger, dizziness and runny nose if they abruptly stop their medicine. Advise patients not stopping BRINTELLIX without talking to their healthcare provider [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Concomitant Medication Advise patients to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter medications because of a potential for interactions. Instruct patients not to take BRINTELLIX with an MAOI or within 14 days of stopping an MAOI and to allow 21 days after stopping BRINTELLIX before starting an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Serotonin Syndrome Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of BRINTELLIX and triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, Lithium, tramadol, tryptophan supplements, and St. John's Wort supplements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . Abnormal Bleeding Caution patients about the increased risk of abnormal bleeding when BRINTELLIX is given with NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Activation of Mania/Hypomania Advise patients and their caregivers to look for signs of activation of mania/hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Angle Closure Glaucoma Patients should be advised that taking BRINTELLIX can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Hyponatremia Advise patients that if they are treated with diuretics, or are otherwise volume depleted, or are elderly, they may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia while taking BRINTELLIX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Nausea Advise patients that nausea is the most common adverse reaction, and is dose related. Nausea commonly occurs within the first week of treatment, then decreases in frequency but can persist in some patients. Alcohol A clinical study has shown that BRINTELLIX (single dose of 20 or 40 mg/day) did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol. Allergic Reactions Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they develop an allergic reaction such as rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. Pregnancy Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with BRINTELLIX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Nursing Mothers Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breast-feeding an infant and would like to continue or start BRINTELLIX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] .

Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED)'],"['2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, sildenafil tablets may be taken anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity ( 2.1 ) Based on effectiveness and toleration, may increase to a maximum of 100 mg or decrease to 25 mg ( 2.1 ) Maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosage Information For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, sildenafil tablets may be taken anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. 2.2 Use with Food Sildenafil tablets may be taken with or without food. 2.3 Dosage Adjustments in Specific Situations Sildenafil tablets was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form is therefore contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. When sildenafil tablets are co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil tablets treatment and sildenafil tablets should be initiated at 25 mg [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Drug Interactions (7.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Due to Drug Interactions Ritonavir The recommended dose for ritonavir-treated patients is 25 mg prior to sexual activity and the recommended maximum dose is 25 mg within a 48 hour period because concomitant administration increased the blood levels of sildenafil by 11-fold [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Drug Interactions (7.4) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Consider a starting dose of 25 mg in patients treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, or saquinavir) or erythromycin. Clinical data have shown that co-administration with saquinavir or erythromycin increased plasma levels of sildenafil by about 3 fold [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Special Populations Consider a starting dose of 25 mg in patients > 65 years, patients with hepatic impairment (e.g., cirrhosis), and patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute) because administration of sildenafil tablets in these patients resulted in higher plasma levels of sildenafil [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6, 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].']","['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Sildenafil tablets, USP are supplied as pale blue to blue, caplet shaped film-coated tablets containing sildenafil citrate USP equivalent to 50 mg, or 100 mg of sildenafil.

Sildenafil tablets was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates ( 4.1 , 7.1 , 12.2 ) Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of tablet ( 4.2 ) Administration with guanylate cyclase (GC) stimulators, such as riociguat ( 4.3 ) 4.1 Nitrates Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 , 12.2 ) ], sildenafil tablets was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form either regularly and/or intermittently is therefore contraindicated. After patients have taken sildenafil tablets, it is unknown when nitrates, if necessary, can be safely administered. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely co-administered at this time point [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 4.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Sildenafil tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to sildenafil, as contained in sildenafil tablets and REVATIO, or any component of the tablet. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including rash and urticaria [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 4.3 Concomitant Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators Do not use sildenafil tablets in patients who are using a GC stimulator, such as riociguat. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.']","['5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients should not use sildenafil if sexual activity is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status ( 5.1 ) Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use sildenafil with caution in patients predisposed to priapism ( 5.2 ) Patients should stop sildenafil tablets and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of non arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Sildenafil tablets should be used with caution, and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks, in patients with a history of NAION. Patients with a ""crowded"" optic disc may also be at an increased risk of NAION. ( 5.3 ) Patients should stop sildenafil tablets and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing ( 5.4 ) Caution is advised when sildenafil is co-administered with alpha-blockers or anti-hypertensives. Concomitant use may lead to hypotension ( 5.5 ) Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection may occur at higher sildenafil exposures. In patients taking strong CYP inhibitors, such as ritonavir, sildenafil exposure is increased. Decrease in sildenafil dosage is recommended ( 2.4 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Use with caution in patients with the following underlying conditions which can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including sildenafil - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50 mmHg) or hypertension (BP >170/110 mmHg); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina. 5.2 Prolonged Erection and Priapism Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of sildenafil tablets. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie\'s disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). However, there are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil in patients with sickle cell or related anemias. 5.3 Effects on the Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including sildenafil , and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely post-marketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged ≥ 50. An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.20). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of “crowded” optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies. Neither the rare post-marketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil , should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with “crowded” optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population, however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, for this uncommon condition. There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); if prescribed, this should be done with caution. 5.4 Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil , and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil . It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ]. 5.5 Hypotension when Co-administered with Alpha-blockers or Anti-hypertensives Alpha-blockers Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may occur. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Anti-hypertensives Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties and may further lower blood pressure in patients taking anti-\xadhypertensive medications. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and sildenafil, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted [ see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.6 Adverse Reactions with the Concomitant Use of Ritonavir The concomitant administration of the protease inhibitor ritonavir substantially increases serum concentrations of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). If sildenafil is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of sildenafil are limited. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of sildenafil (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse reactions in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in sildenafil dosage is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Drug Interactions (7.4) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.7 Combination with other PDE5 Inhibitors or Other Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of sildenafil with other PDE5 Inhibitors, including REVATIO or other pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatments containing sildenafil, or other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Such combinations may further lower blood pressure. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. 5.8 Effects on Bleeding There have been postmarketing reports of bleeding events in patients who have taken sildenafil . A causal relationship between sildenafil and these events has not been established. In humans, sildenafil has no effect on bleeding time when taken alone or with aspirin. However, in vitro studies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor). In addition, the combination of heparin and sildenafil had an additive effect on bleeding time in the anesthetized rabbit, but this interaction has not been studied in humans. The safety of sildenafil is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. 5.9 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of sildenafil offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), may be considered.']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Prolonged Erection and Priapism [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Effects on the Eye [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hearing Loss [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypotension when Co-administered with Alpha-blockers or Anti-hypertensives [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Adverse Reactions with the Concomitant Use of Ritonavir [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Combination with other PDE5 Inhibitors or Other Erectile Dysfunction Therapies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Effects on Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials (≥ 2%) are headache, flushing, dyspepsia, abnormal vision, nasal congestion, back pain, myalgia, nausea, dizziness, and rash. Most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, abnormal vision, nasal congestion, back pain, myalgia, nausea, dizziness and rash ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Nivagen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-877-977-0687 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Sildenafil was administered to over 3700 patients (aged 19-87 years) during pre-marketing clinical trials worldwide. Over 550 patients were treated for longer than one year. In placebo-controlled clinical studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions for sildenafil (2.5%) was not significantly different from placebo (2.3%). In fixed-dose studies, the incidence of some adverse reactions increased with dose. The type of adverse reactions in flexible-dose studies, which reflect the recommended dosage regimen, was similar to that for fixed- dose studies. At doses above the recommended dose range, adverse reactions were similar to those detailed in Table 1 below but generally were reported more frequently. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with sildenafil and More Frequent than Placebo in Fixed-Dose Phase II/III Studies Adverse Reaction 25 mg (n=312) 50 mg (n=511) 100 mg (n=506) Placebo (n=607) Headache 16% 21% 28% 7% Flushing 10% 19% 18% 2% Dyspepsia 3% 9% 17% 2% Abnormal vision† 1% 2% 11% 1% Nasal congestion 4% 4% 9% 2% Back pain 3% 4% 4% 2% Myalgia 2% 2% 4% 1% Nausea 2% 3% 3% 1% Dizziness 3% 4% 3% 2% Rash 1% 2% 3% 1% † Abnormal Vision: Mild to moderate in severity and transient, predominantly color tinge to vision, but also increased sensitivity to light, or blurred vision. When sildenafil was taken as recommended (on an as-needed basis) in flexible-dose, placebo-controlled clinical trials of two to twenty-six weeks duration, patients took sildenafil at least once weekly, and the following adverse reactions were reported: Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥2% of Patients Treated with sildenafil and More Frequent than Placebo in Flexible-Dose Phase II/III Studies Adverse Reaction SILDENAFIL CITRATE PLACEBO N=734 N=725 Headache 16% 4% Flushing 10% 1% Dyspepsia 7% 2% Nasal Congestion 4% 2% Abnormal Vision † 3% 0% Back pain 2% 2% Dizziness 2% 1% Rash 2% 1% † Abnormal Vision: Mild and transient, predominantly color tinge to vision, but also increased sensitivity to light or blurred vision. In these studies, only one patient discontinued due to abnormal vision. The following events occurred in <2% of patients in controlled clinical trials; a causal relationship to sildenafil is uncertain. Reported events include those with a plausible relation to drug use; omitted are minor events and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: Body as a Whole: face edema, photosensitivity reaction, shock, asthenia, pain, chills, accidental fall, abdominal pain, allergic reaction, chest pain, accidental injury. Cardiovascular: angina pectoris, AV block, migraine, syncope, tachycardia, palpitation, hypotension, postural hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cardiac arrest, heart failure, abnormal electrocardiogram, cardiomyopathy. Digestive: vomiting, glossitis, colitis, dysphagia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, esophagitis, stomatitis, dry mouth, liver function tests abnormal, rectal hemorrhage, gingivitis. Hemic and Lymphatic: anemia and leukopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional: thirst, edema, gout, unstable diabetes, hyperglycemia, peripheral edema, hyperuricemia, hypoglycemic reaction, hypernatremia. Musculoskeletal: arthritis, arthrosis, myalgia, tendon rupture, tenosynovitis, bone pain, myasthenia, synovitis. Nervous: ataxia, hypertonia, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo, depression, insomnia, somnolence, abnormal dreams, reflexes decreased, hypesthesia. Respiratory: asthma, dyspnea, laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, sputum increased, cough increased. Skin and Appendages: urticaria, herpes simplex, pruritus, sweating, skin ulcer, contact dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis. Special Senses: sudden decrease or loss of hearing, mydriasis, conjunctivitis, photophobia, tinnitus, eye pain, ear pain, eye hemorrhage, cataract, dry eyes. Urogenital: cystitis, nocturia, urinary frequency, breast enlargement, urinary incontinence, abnormal ejaculation, genital edema and anorgasmia. Analysis of the safety database from controlled clinical trials showed no apparent difference in adverse reactions in patients taking sildenafil with and without anti-hypertensive medication. This analysis was performed retrospectively, and was not powered to detect any pre-specified difference in adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular Serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been reported post-marketing in temporal association with the use of sildenafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of sildenafil and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient’s underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Hemic and Lymphatic: vaso-occlusive crisis: In a small, prematurely terminated study of REVATIO (sildenafil) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to sickle cell disease, vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization were more commonly reported in patients who received sildenafil than in those randomized to placebo. The clinical relevance of this finding to men treated with sildenafil for ED is not known. Nervous: seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia. Respiratory: epistaxis Special senses: Hearing: Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of sildenafil, to the patient’s underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Ocular: diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal edema, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, and vitreous traction/detachment. Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported rarely post-marketing in temporal association with the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including sildenafil.

Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway, sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Contraindications (4.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 7.2 Alpha-blockers Use caution when co-administering alpha-blockers with sildenafil because of potential additive blood pressure-lowering effects. When sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 7.3 Amlodipine When sildenafil 100 mg was co-administered with amlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 7.4 Ritonavir and other CYP3A4 inhibitors Co-administration of ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, greatly increased the systemic exposure of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). It is therefore recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg of sildenafil in a 48 hour period [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Co-administration of erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a 160% and 182% increases in sildenafil C max and AUC, respectively. Co-administration of saquinavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in 140% and 210% increases in sildenafil C max and AUC, respectively. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effects than seen with saquinavir. A starting dose of 25 mg of sildenafil should be considered in patients taking erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.5 Alcohol In a drug-drug interaction study sildenafil 50 mg given with alcohol 0.5 g/kg in which mean maximum blood alcohol levels of 0.08% was achieved, sildenafil did not potentiate the hypotensive effect of alcohol in healthy volunteers [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ].']","['8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric use: Consider a starting dose of 25 mg ( 2.5 , 8.5 ) Severe renal impairment: Consider a starting dose of 25 mg ( 2.5 , 8.6 ) Hepatic impairment: Consider a starting dose of 25 mg ( 2.5 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sildenafil is not indicated for use in females. There are no data with the use of sildenafil in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies conducted with sildenafil did not show adverse developmental outcomes when administered during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 16 and 32 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis ( see Data ). Data Animal Data No evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits which received oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day during organogenesis. These doses represent, respectively, about 16 and 32 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis in a 50 kg subject. In the rat pre- and postnatal development study, the no observed adverse effect dose was 30 mg/kg/day given for 36 days, about 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis in a 50 kg subject. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sildenafil is not indicated for use in females. Limited data indicate that sildenafil and its active metabolite are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Sildenafil is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy young volunteers (18-45 years) [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of sildenafil, 18% were 65 years and older, while 2% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older (≥ 65 years of age) and younger (< 65 years of age) subjects. However, since higher plasma levels may increase the incidence of adverse reactions, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in older subjects due to the higher systemic exposure [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required for mild (CLcr=50-80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr=30-49 mL/min) renal impairment. In volunteers with severe renal impairment (Clcr<30 mL/min), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (~2 fold), approximately doubling of C max and AUC. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in higher plasma exposure of sildenafil (47% for C max and 85% for AUC). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. A starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].']","['8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sildenafil is not indicated for use in females.

NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil enhances the effect of NO by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Binding Characteristics Studies in vitro have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (10-fold for PDE6, >80-fold for PDE1, >700-fold for PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9, PDE10, and PDE11). Sildenafil is approximately 4,000-fold more selective for PDE5 compared to PDE3. PDE3 is involved in control of cardiac contractility. Sildenafil is only about 10-fold as potent for PDE5 compared to PDE6, an enzyme found in the retina which is involved in the phototransduction pathway of the retina. This lower selectivity is thought to be the basis for abnormalities related to color vision [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In addition to human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, PDE5 is also found in other tissues including platelets, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle, brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, bladder, testis, and seminal vesicle. The inhibition of PDE5 in some of these tissues by sildenafil may be the basis for the enhanced platelet antiaggregatory activity of NO observed in vitro , an inhibition of platelet thrombus formation in vivo and peripheral arterial-venous dilatation in vivo. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects of sildenafil on Erectile Response: In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (RigiScan ® ), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post dose. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan ® , generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours. Effects of sildenafil on Blood Pressure: Single oral doses of sildenafil (100 mg) administered to healthy volunteers produced decreases in sitting blood pressure (mean maximum decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 8.3/5.3 mmHg). The decrease in sitting blood pressure was most notable approximately 1-2 hours after dosing, and was not different than placebo at 8 hours. Similar effects on blood pressure were noted with 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of sildenafil, therefore the effects are not related to dose or plasma levels within this dosage range. Larger effects were recorded among patients receiving concomitant nitrates [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Effects of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Nitroglycerin is Subsequently Administered: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 100 mg oral dose given to healthy normal volunteers, the plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are approximately 2 ng/mL (compared to peak plasma levels of approximately 440 ng/mL). In the following patients: age >65 years, hepatic impairment (e.g., cirrhosis), severe renal impairment (e.g., creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), and concomitant use of erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose have been found to be 3 to 8 times higher than those seen in healthy volunteers. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely co-administered at this time point [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Effects of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Alpha-Blockers: Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover studies were conducted to assess the interaction of sildenafil with doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. Study 1: Sildenafil with Doxazosin In the first study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 2-period crossover design to 4 generally healthy males with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Following at least 14 consecutive daily doses of doxazosin, sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin. Following a review of the data from these first 4 subjects (details provided below), the sildenafil dose was reduced to 25 mg. Thereafter, 17 subjects were treated with sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo in combination with doxazosin 4 mg (15 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (2 subjects). The mean subject age was 66.5 years. For the 17 subjects who received sildenafil 25 mg and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows: Placebo-subtracted mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) sildenafil citrate 25 mg Supine 7.4 (-0.9, 15.7) Standing 6.0 (-0.8, 12.8) The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 25 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 2. Blood pressure was measured immediately pre-dose and at 15, 30, 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after sildenafil or matching placebo. Outliers were defined as subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure of <85 mmHg or a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of >30 mmHg at one or more timepoints. There were no subjects treated with sildenafil 25 mg who had a standing SBP < 85mmHg. There were three subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP >30mmHg following sildenafil 25 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following placebo and two subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil and placebo. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in this group. Of the four subjects who received sildenafil 100 mg in the first part of this study, a severe adverse event related to blood pressure effect was reported in one patient (postural hypotension that began 35 minutes after dosing with sildenafil with symptoms lasting for 8 hours), and mild adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in two others (dizziness, headache and fatigue at 1 hour after dosing; and dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea at 4 hours after dosing). There were no reports of syncope among these patients. For these four subjects, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline in supine and standing systolic blood pressures were 14.8 mmHg and 21.5 mmHg, respectively. Two of these subjects had a standing SBP < 85mmHg. Both of these subjects were protocol violators, one due to a low baseline standing SBP, and the other due to baseline orthostatic hypotension. Study 2: Sildenafil with Doxazosin In the second study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 50 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 2-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH. Following at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin, sildenafil 50 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (17 subjects) or with doxazosin 8 mg (3 subjects). The mean subject age in this study was 63.9 years. Twenty subjects received sildenafil 50 mg, but only 19 subjects received matching placebo. One patient discontinued the study prematurely due to an adverse event of hypotension following dosing with sildenafil 50 mg. This patient had been taking minoxidil, a potent vasodilator, during the study. For the 19 subjects who received both sildenafil and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows: Placebo-subtracted mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure(mm Hg) sildenafil citrate 50 mg(95% CI) Supine 9.08 (5.48, 12.68) Standing 11.62 (7.34, 15.90) The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 50 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 3. Blood pressure was measured after administration of sildenafil at the same times as those specified for the first doxazosin study. There were two subjects who had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg. In these two subjects, hypotension was reported as a moderately severe adverse event, beginning at approximately 1 hour after administration of sildenafil 50 mg and resolving after approximately 7.5 hours. There was one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP >30mmHg following sildenafil 50 mg and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil 50 mg and placebo. There were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure and no episodes of syncope reported in this study. Study 3: Sildenafil with Doxazosin In the third study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 3-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH. In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin. If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study. Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study (using sildenafil 50 mg), including no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1. Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1. Thereafter, sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion. The mean subject age in this study was 66.4 years. Twenty-five subjects were screened. Two were discontinued after study period 1: one failed to meet pre-dose screening qualifications and the other experienced symptomatic hypotension as a moderately severe adverse event 30 minutes after dosing with open-label sildenafil 50 mg. Of the twenty subjects who were ultimately assigned to treatment, a total of 13 subjects successfully completed dose period 1, and seven had successfully completed the previous doxazosin study (using sildenafil 50 mg). For the 20 subjects who received sildenafil 100 mg and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows: Placebo-subtracted mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure(mm Hg) sildenafil citrate 100 mg Supine 7.9 (4.6, 11.1) Standing 4.3 (-1.8,10.3) The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 100 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 4. Blood pressure was measured after administration of sildenafil at the same times as those specified for the previous doxazosin studies. There were three subjects who had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg. All three were taking sildenafil 100 mg, and all three reported mild adverse events at the time of reductions in standing SBP, including vasodilation and lightheadedness. There were four subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following sildenafil 100 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following placebo and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil and placebo. While there were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure reported in this study, one subject reported moderate vasodilatation after both sildenafil 50 mg and 100 mg. There were no episodes of syncope reported in this study. Effect of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Anti-hypertensives: When sildenafil 100 mg oral was co-administered with amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg oral, to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic. Effect of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Alcohol: Sildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effect of alcohol (0.5 g/kg) in healthy volunteers with mean maximum blood alcohol levels of 0.08%. The maximum observed decrease in systolic blood pressure was -18.5 mmHg when sildenafil was co-administered with alcohol versus -17.4 mmHg when alcohol was administered alone. The maximum observed decrease in diastolic blood pressure was -17.2 mmHg when sildenafil was co-administered with alcohol versus -11.1 mmHg when alcohol was administered alone. There were no reports of postural dizziness or orthostatic hypotension. The maximum recommended dose of 100 mg sildenafil was not evaluated in this study [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Effects of sildenafil on Cardiac Parameters: Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg produced no clinically relevant changes in the ECGs of normal male volunteers. Studies have produced relevant data on the effects of sildenafil on cardiac output. In one small, open-label, uncontrolled, pilot study, eight patients with stable ischemic heart disease underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization. A total dose of 40 mg sildenafil was administered by four intravenous infusions. The results from this pilot study are shown in Table 3; the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7% and 10% compared to baseline in these patients. Mean resting values for right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occluded pressure and cardiac output decreased by 28%, 28%, 20% and 7% respectively. Even though this total dosage produced plasma sildenafil concentrations which were approximately 2 to 5 times higher than the mean maximum plasma concentrations following a single oral dose of 100 mg in healthy male volunteers, the hemodynamic response to exercise was preserved in these patients. Table 3. Hemodynamic Data in Patients with Stable Ischemic Heart Disease after Intravenous Administration of 40 mg of Sildenafil Means ± SD At rest After 4 minutes of exercise N Baseline (B2) n Sildenafil (D1) n Baseline n Sildenafil PAOP (mmHg) 8 8.1 ± 5.1 8 6.5 ± 4.3 8 36.0 ± 13.7 8 27.8 ± 15.3 Mean PAP (mmHg) 8 16.7 ± 4 8 12.1 ± 3.9 8 39.4 ± 12.9 8 31.7 ± 13.2 Mean RAP (mmHg) 7 5.7 ± 3.7 8 4.1 ± 3.7 - - - - Systolic SAP (mmHg) 8 150.4 ± 12.4 8 140.6 ± 16.5 8 199.5 ± 37.4 8 187.8 ± 30.0 Diastolic SAP (mmHg) 8 73.6 ± 7.8 8 65.9 ± 10 8 84.6 ± 9.7 8 79.5 ± 9.4 Cardiac output (L/min) 8 5.6 ± 0.9 8 5.2 ± 1.1 8 11.5 ± 2.4 8 10.2 ± 3.5 Heart rate (bpm) 8 67 ± 11.1 8 66.9 ± 12 8 101.9 ± 11.6 8 99.0 ± 20.4 In a double-blind study, 144 patients with erectile dysfunction and chronic stable angina limited by exercise, not receiving chronic oral nitrates, were randomized to a single dose of placebo or sildenafil 100 mg 1 hour prior to exercise testing. The primary endpoint was time to limiting angina in the evaluable cohort. The mean times (adjusted for baseline) to onset of limiting angina were 423.6 and 403.7 seconds for sildenafil (N=70) and placebo, respectively. These results demonstrated that the effect of sildenafil on the primary endpoint was statistically non-inferior to placebo. Effects of sildenafil on Vision: At single oral doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, transient dose-related impairment of color discrimination was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, with peak effects near the time of peak plasma levels. This finding is consistent with the inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in phototransduction in the retina. Subjects in the study reported this finding as difficulties in discriminating blue/green. An evaluation of visual function at doses up to twice the maximum recommended dose revealed no effects of sildenafil on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or pupillometry. Effects of sildenafil on Sperm: There was no effect on sperm motility or morphology after single 100 mg oral doses of sildenafil in healthy volunteers. sildenafil-citrate-figure-1 sildenafil-citrate-figure-2 sildenafil-citrate-figure-3 sildenafil-citrate-figure-4 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil are dose-proportional over the recommended dose range. It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly CYP3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, sildenafil. Both sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Mean sildenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg to healthy male volunteers is depicted below: Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced, with a mean delay in T max of 60 minutes and a mean reduction in C max of 29%. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) for sildenafil is 105 L, indicating distribution into the tissues. Sildenafil and its major circulating N-desmethyl metabolite are both approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding is independent of total drug concentrations. Based upon measurements of sildenafil in semen of healthy volunteers 90 minutes after dosing, less than 0.001% of the administered dose may appear in the semen of patients. Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared predominantly by the CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. The major circulating metabolite results from N-desmethylation of sildenafil, and is itself further metabolized. This metabolite has a PDE selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an in vitro potency for PDE5 approximately 50% of the parent drug. Plasma concentrations of this metabolite are approximately 40% of those seen for sildenafil, so that the metabolite accounts for about 20% of sildenafil’s pharmacologic effects. After either oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Similar values for pharmacokinetic parameters were seen in normal volunteers and in the patient population, using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years). Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] Renal Impairment: In volunteers with mild (CLcr=50-80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr=30-49 mL/min) renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of sildenafil (50 mg) were not altered. In volunteers with severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment, sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately doubling of AUC and C max compared to age-matched volunteers with no renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. In addition, N-desmethyl metabolite AUC and C max values significantly increased by 200% and 79%, respectively in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Hepatic Impairment: In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in increases in AUC (85%) and C max (47%) compared to age-matched volunteers with no hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Therefore, age >65, hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment are associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil. A starting oral dose of 25 mg should be considered in those patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Other Drugs on sildenafil Sildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce sildenafil clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase sildenafil clearance. The concomitant use of erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole) as well as the nonspecific CYP inhibitor, cimetidine, is associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. In vivo studies: Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma sildenafil concentrations when co-administered with sildenafil (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of sildenafil was administered with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 160% increase in sildenafil C max and a 182% increase in sildenafil AUC. In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil C max and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. A stronger CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effect than that seen with saquinavir. Population pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials also indicated a reduction in sildenafil clearance when it was co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. In another study in healthy male volunteers, co-administration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil C max and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when sildenafil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Sildenafil had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and sildenafil has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase sildenafil levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of sildenafil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of sildenafil AUC and a 55% decrease in sildenafil C max . Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of sildenafil. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of sildenafil. In healthy male volunteers, there was no evidence of a clinically significant effect of azithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days) on the systemic exposure of sildenafil or its major circulating metabolite. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on sildenafil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl sildenafil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence. Effects of sildenafil on Other Drugs In vitro studies: Sildenafil is a weak inhibitor of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 (IC50 >150 µM). Given sildenafil peak plasma concentrations of approximately 1 µM after recommended doses, it is unlikely that sildenafil will alter the clearance of substrates of these isoenzymes. In vivo studies: No significant interactions were shown with tolbutamide (250 mg) or warfarin (40 mg), both of which are metabolized by CYP2C9. In a study of healthy male volunteers, sildenafil (100 mg) did not affect the steady state pharmacokinetics of the HIV protease inhibitors, saquinavir and ritonavir, both of which are CYP3A4 substrates. Sildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin (150 mg). Sildenafil at steady state, at a dose not approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (80 mg t.i.d.) resulted in a 50% increase in AUC and a 42% increase in C max of bosentan (125 mg b.i.d.). sildenafil-citrate-figure-5""]","['12.1 Mechanism of Action The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil enhances the effect of NO by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Binding Characteristics Studies in vitro have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (10-fold for PDE6, >80-fold for PDE1, >700-fold for PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9, PDE10, and PDE11). Sildenafil is approximately 4,000-fold more selective for PDE5 compared to PDE3. PDE3 is involved in control of cardiac contractility. Sildenafil is only about 10-fold as potent for PDE5 compared to PDE6, an enzyme found in the retina which is involved in the phototransduction pathway of the retina. This lower selectivity is thought to be the basis for abnormalities related to color vision [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. In addition to human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, PDE5 is also found in other tissues including platelets, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle, brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, bladder, testis, and seminal vesicle. The inhibition of PDE5 in some of these tissues by sildenafil may be the basis for the enhanced platelet antiaggregatory activity of NO observed in vitro , an inhibition of platelet thrombus formation in vivo and peripheral arterial-venous dilatation in vivo.']","['12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effects of sildenafil on Erectile Response: In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (RigiScan ® ), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post dose. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan ® , generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours. Effects of sildenafil on Blood Pressure: Single oral doses of sildenafil (100 mg) administered to healthy volunteers produced decreases in sitting blood pressure (mean maximum decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 8.3/5.3 mmHg). The decrease in sitting blood pressure was most notable approximately 1-2 hours after dosing, and was not different than placebo at 8 hours. Similar effects on blood pressure were noted with 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of sildenafil, therefore the effects are not related to dose or plasma levels within this dosage range. Larger effects were recorded among patients receiving concomitant nitrates [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Effects of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Nitroglycerin is Subsequently Administered: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 100 mg oral dose given to healthy normal volunteers, the plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are approximately 2 ng/mL (compared to peak plasma levels of approximately 440 ng/mL). In the following patients: age >65 years, hepatic impairment (e.g., cirrhosis), severe renal impairment (e.g., creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), and concomitant use of erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose have been found to be 3 to 8 times higher than those seen in healthy volunteers. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely co-administered at this time point [ see Contraindications (4.1) ]. Effects of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Alpha-Blockers: Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover studies were conducted to assess the interaction of sildenafil with doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. Study 1: Sildenafil with Doxazosin In the first study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 2-period crossover design to 4 generally healthy males with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Following at least 14 consecutive daily doses of doxazosin, sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin. Following a review of the data from these first 4 subjects (details provided below), the sildenafil dose was reduced to 25 mg. Thereafter, 17 subjects were treated with sildenafil 25 mg or matching placebo in combination with doxazosin 4 mg (15 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (2 subjects). The mean subject age was 66.5 years. For the 17 subjects who received sildenafil 25 mg and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows: Placebo-subtracted mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) sildenafil citrate 25 mg Supine 7.4 (-0.9, 15.7) Standing 6.0 (-0.8, 12.8) The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 25 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 2. Blood pressure was measured immediately pre-dose and at 15, 30, 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after sildenafil or matching placebo. Outliers were defined as subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure of <85 mmHg or a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of >30 mmHg at one or more timepoints. There were no subjects treated with sildenafil 25 mg who had a standing SBP < 85mmHg. There were three subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP >30mmHg following sildenafil 25 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following placebo and two subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil and placebo. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in this group. Of the four subjects who received sildenafil 100 mg in the first part of this study, a severe adverse event related to blood pressure effect was reported in one patient (postural hypotension that began 35 minutes after dosing with sildenafil with symptoms lasting for 8 hours), and mild adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in two others (dizziness, headache and fatigue at 1 hour after dosing; and dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea at 4 hours after dosing). There were no reports of syncope among these patients. For these four subjects, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline in supine and standing systolic blood pressures were 14.8 mmHg and 21.5 mmHg, respectively. Two of these subjects had a standing SBP < 85mmHg. Both of these subjects were protocol violators, one due to a low baseline standing SBP, and the other due to baseline orthostatic hypotension. Study 2: Sildenafil with Doxazosin In the second study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 50 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 2-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH. Following at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin, sildenafil 50 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (17 subjects) or with doxazosin 8 mg (3 subjects). The mean subject age in this study was 63.9 years. Twenty subjects received sildenafil 50 mg, but only 19 subjects received matching placebo. One patient discontinued the study prematurely due to an adverse event of hypotension following dosing with sildenafil 50 mg. This patient had been taking minoxidil, a potent vasodilator, during the study. For the 19 subjects who received both sildenafil and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows: Placebo-subtracted mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure(mm Hg) sildenafil citrate 50 mg(95% CI) Supine 9.08 (5.48, 12.68) Standing 11.62 (7.34, 15.90) The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 50 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 3. Blood pressure was measured after administration of sildenafil at the same times as those specified for the first doxazosin study. There were two subjects who had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg. In these two subjects, hypotension was reported as a moderately severe adverse event, beginning at approximately 1 hour after administration of sildenafil 50 mg and resolving after approximately 7.5 hours. There was one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP >30mmHg following sildenafil 50 mg and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil 50 mg and placebo. There were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure and no episodes of syncope reported in this study. Study 3: Sildenafil with Doxazosin In the third study, a single oral dose of sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a 3-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH. In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin. If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study. Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study (using sildenafil 50 mg), including no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1. Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1. Thereafter, sildenafil 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion. The mean subject age in this study was 66.4 years. Twenty-five subjects were screened. Two were discontinued after study period 1: one failed to meet pre-dose screening qualifications and the other experienced symptomatic hypotension as a moderately severe adverse event 30 minutes after dosing with open-label sildenafil 50 mg. Of the twenty subjects who were ultimately assigned to treatment, a total of 13 subjects successfully completed dose period 1, and seven had successfully completed the previous doxazosin study (using sildenafil 50 mg). For the 20 subjects who received sildenafil 100 mg and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were as follows: Placebo-subtracted mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure(mm Hg) sildenafil citrate 100 mg Supine 7.9 (4.6, 11.1) Standing 4.3 (-1.8,10.3) The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 100 mg sildenafil or matching placebo are shown in Figure 4. Blood pressure was measured after administration of sildenafil at the same times as those specified for the previous doxazosin studies. There were three subjects who had a standing SBP of < 85 mmHg. All three were taking sildenafil 100 mg, and all three reported mild adverse events at the time of reductions in standing SBP, including vasodilation and lightheadedness. There were four subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following sildenafil 100 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following placebo and one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP > 30 mmHg following both sildenafil and placebo. While there were no severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure reported in this study, one subject reported moderate vasodilatation after both sildenafil 50 mg and 100 mg. There were no episodes of syncope reported in this study. Effect of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Anti-hypertensives: When sildenafil 100 mg oral was co-administered with amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg oral, to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic. Effect of sildenafil on Blood Pressure When Co-administered with Alcohol: Sildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effect of alcohol (0.5 g/kg) in healthy volunteers with mean maximum blood alcohol levels of 0.08%. The maximum observed decrease in systolic blood pressure was -18.5 mmHg when sildenafil was co-administered with alcohol versus -17.4 mmHg when alcohol was administered alone. The maximum observed decrease in diastolic blood pressure was -17.2 mmHg when sildenafil was co-administered with alcohol versus -11.1 mmHg when alcohol was administered alone. There were no reports of postural dizziness or orthostatic hypotension. The maximum recommended dose of 100 mg sildenafil was not evaluated in this study [ see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Effects of sildenafil on Cardiac Parameters: Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg produced no clinically relevant changes in the ECGs of normal male volunteers. Studies have produced relevant data on the effects of sildenafil on cardiac output. In one small, open-label, uncontrolled, pilot study, eight patients with stable ischemic heart disease underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization. A total dose of 40 mg sildenafil was administered by four intravenous infusions. The results from this pilot study are shown in Table 3; the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7% and 10% compared to baseline in these patients. Mean resting values for right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occluded pressure and cardiac output decreased by 28%, 28%, 20% and 7% respectively. Even though this total dosage produced plasma sildenafil concentrations which were approximately 2 to 5 times higher than the mean maximum plasma concentrations following a single oral dose of 100 mg in healthy male volunteers, the hemodynamic response to exercise was preserved in these patients. Table 3.

The primary endpoint was time to limiting angina in the evaluable cohort. The mean times (adjusted for baseline) to onset of limiting angina were 423.6 and 403.7 seconds for sildenafil (N=70) and placebo, respectively. These results demonstrated that the effect of sildenafil on the primary endpoint was statistically non-inferior to placebo. Effects of sildenafil on Vision: At single oral doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, transient dose-related impairment of color discrimination was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, with peak effects near the time of peak plasma levels. This finding is consistent with the inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in phototransduction in the retina. Subjects in the study reported this finding as difficulties in discriminating blue/green. An evaluation of visual function at doses up to twice the maximum recommended dose revealed no effects of sildenafil on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or pupillometry. Effects of sildenafil on Sperm: There was no effect on sperm motility or morphology after single 100 mg oral doses of sildenafil in healthy volunteers. sildenafil-citrate-figure-1 sildenafil-citrate-figure-2 sildenafil-citrate-figure-3 sildenafil-citrate-figure-4']","[""12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil are dose-proportional over the recommended dose range. It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly CYP3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, sildenafil. Both sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Mean sildenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg to healthy male volunteers is depicted below: Absorption and Distribution: Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced, with a mean delay in T max of 60 minutes and a mean reduction in C max of 29%. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) for sildenafil is 105 L, indicating distribution into the tissues. Sildenafil and its major circulating N-desmethyl metabolite are both approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding is independent of total drug concentrations. Based upon measurements of sildenafil in semen of healthy volunteers 90 minutes after dosing, less than 0.001% of the administered dose may appear in the semen of patients. Metabolism and Excretion: Sildenafil is cleared predominantly by the CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. The major circulating metabolite results from N-desmethylation of sildenafil, and is itself further metabolized. This metabolite has a PDE selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an in vitro potency for PDE5 approximately 50% of the parent drug. Plasma concentrations of this metabolite are approximately 40% of those seen for sildenafil, so that the metabolite accounts for about 20% of sildenafil’s pharmacologic effects. After either oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Similar values for pharmacokinetic parameters were seen in normal volunteers and in the patient population, using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years). Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] Renal Impairment: In volunteers with mild (CLcr=50-80 mL/min) and moderate (CLcr=30-49 mL/min) renal impairment, the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of sildenafil (50 mg) were not altered. In volunteers with severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment, sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in approximately doubling of AUC and C max compared to age-matched volunteers with no renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. In addition, N-desmethyl metabolite AUC and C max values significantly increased by 200% and 79%, respectively in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. Hepatic Impairment: In volunteers with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B), sildenafil clearance was reduced, resulting in increases in AUC (85%) and C max (47%) compared to age-matched volunteers with no hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in patients with severely impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Therefore, age >65, hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment are associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil. A starting oral dose of 25 mg should be considered in those patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Effects of Other Drugs on sildenafil Sildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce sildenafil clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase sildenafil clearance. The concomitant use of erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole) as well as the nonspecific CYP inhibitor, cimetidine, is associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. In vivo studies: Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma sildenafil concentrations when co-administered with sildenafil (50 mg) to healthy volunteers. When a single 100 mg dose of sildenafil was administered with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 160% increase in sildenafil C max and a 182% increase in sildenafil AUC. In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil C max and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. A stronger CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effect than that seen with saquinavir. Population pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials also indicated a reduction in sildenafil clearance when it was co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine) [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. In another study in healthy male volunteers, co-administration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with sildenafil (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil C max and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when sildenafil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavir's marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Sildenafil had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Although the interaction between other protease inhibitors and sildenafil has not been studied, their concomitant use is expected to increase sildenafil levels. In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of sildenafil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of sildenafil AUC and a 55% decrease in sildenafil C max . Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of sildenafil. Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of sildenafil. In healthy male volunteers, there was no evidence of a clinically significant effect of azithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days) on the systemic exposure of sildenafil or its major circulating metabolite. Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on sildenafil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl sildenafil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence. Effects of sildenafil on Other Drugs In vitro studies: Sildenafil is a weak inhibitor of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 (IC50 >150 µM). Given sildenafil peak plasma concentrations of approximately 1 µM after recommended doses, it is unlikely that sildenafil will alter the clearance of substrates of these isoenzymes. In vivo studies: No significant interactions were shown with tolbutamide (250 mg) or warfarin (40 mg), both of which are metabolized by CYP2C9. In a study of healthy male volunteers, sildenafil (100 mg) did not affect the steady state pharmacokinetics of the HIV protease inhibitors, saquinavir and ritonavir, both of which are CYP3A4 substrates. Sildenafil (50 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin (150 mg). Sildenafil at steady state, at a dose not approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (80 mg t.i.d.) resulted in a 50% increase in AUC and a 42% increase in C max of bosentan (125 mg b.i.d.). sildenafil-citrate-figure-5""]","['13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 24 months at a dose resulting in total systemic drug exposure (AUCs) for unbound sildenafil and its major metabolite of 20- and 38- times, for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 100 mg.

Sildenafil was evaluated primarily at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in 21 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months in duration, using a variety of study designs (fixed dose, titration, parallel, crossover). Sildenafil was administered to more than 3,000 patients aged 19 to 87 years, with ED of various etiologies (organic, psychogenic, mixed) with a mean duration of 5 years. Sildenafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in all 21 studies. The studies that established benefit demonstrated improvements in success rates for sexual intercourse compared with placebo. Efficacy Endpoints in Controlled Clinical Studies The effectiveness of sildenafil was evaluated in most studies using several assessment instruments. The primary measure in the principal studies was a sexual function questionnaire (the International Index of Erectile Function-IIEF) administered during a 4-week treatment-free run-in period, at baseline, at follow-up visits, and at the end of double-blind, placebo-controlled, at-home treatment. Two of the questions from the IIEF served as primary study endpoints; categorical responses were elicited to questions about (1) the ability to achieve erections sufficient for sexual intercourse and (2) the maintenance of erections after penetration. The patient addressed both questions at the final visit for the last 4 weeks of the study. The possible categorical responses to these questions were (0) no attempted intercourse, (1) never or almost never, (2) a few times, (3) sometimes, (4) most times, and (5) almost always or always. Also collected as part of the IIEF was information about other aspects of sexual function, including information on erectile function, orgasm, desire, satisfaction with intercourse, and overall sexual satisfaction. Sexual function data were also recorded by patients in a daily diary. In addition, patients were asked a global efficacy question and an optional partner questionnaire was administered. Efficacy Results from Controlled Clinical Studies The effect on one of the major end points, maintenance of erections after penetration, is shown in Figure 6, for the pooled results of 5 fixed-dose, dose-response studies of greater than one month duration, showing response according to baseline function. Results with all doses have been pooled, but scores showed greater improvement at the 50 and 100 mg doses than at 25 mg. The pattern of responses was similar for the other principal question, the ability to achieve an erection sufficient for intercourse. The titration studies, in which most patients received 100 mg, showed similar results. Figure 6 shows that regardless of the baseline levels of function, subsequent function in patients treated with sildenafil was better than that seen in patients treated with placebo. At the same time, on-treatment function was better in treated patients who were less impaired at baseline. Figure 6. Effect of sildenafil and Placebo on Maintenance of Erection by Baseline Score. The frequency of patients reporting improvement of erections in response to a global question in four of the randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled fixed dose studies (1797 patients) of 12 to 24 weeks duration is shown in Figure 7. These patients had erectile dysfunction at baseline that was characterized by median categorical scores of 2 (a few times) on principal IIEF questions. Erectile dysfunction was attributed to organic (58%; generally not characterized, but including diabetes and excluding spinal cord injury), psychogenic (17%), or mixed (24%) etiologies. Sixty-three percent, 74%, and 82% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of sildenafil, respectively, reported an improvement in their erections, compared to 24% on placebo. In the titration studies (n=644) (with most patients eventually receiving 100 mg), results were similar. Overall treatment p<0.0001 Figure 7. Percentage of Patients Reporting an Improvement in Erections. The patients in studies had varying degrees of ED. One-third to one-half of the subjects in these studies reported successful intercourse at least once during a 4-week, treatment-free run-in period. In many of the studies, of both fixed dose and titration designs, daily diaries were kept by patients. In these studies, involving about 1600 patients, analyses of patient diaries showed no effect of sildenafil on rates of attempted intercourse (about 2 per week), but there was clear treatment-related improvement in sexual function: per patient weekly success rates averaged 1.3 on 50-100 mg of sildenafil vs 0.4 on placebo; similarly, group mean success rates (total successes divided by total attempts) were about 66% on sildenafil vs about 20% on placebo. During 3 to 6 months of double-blind treatment or longer-term (1 year), open-label studies, few patients withdrew from active treatment for any reason, including lack of effectiveness. At the end of the long-term study, 88% of patients reported that sildenafil improved their erections. Men with untreated ED had relatively low baseline scores for all aspects of sexual function measured (again using a 5-point scale) in the IIEF. Sildenafil improved these aspects of sexual function: frequency, firmness and maintenance of erections; frequency of orgasm; frequency and level of desire; frequency, satisfaction and enjoyment of intercourse; and overall relationship satisfaction. One randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study included only patients with erectile dysfunction attributed to complications of diabetes mellitus (n=268). As in the other titration studies, patients were started on 50 mg and allowed to adjust the dose up to 100 mg or down to 25 mg of sildenafil; all patients, however, were receiving 50 mg or 100 mg at the end of the study. There were highly statistically significant improvements on the two principal IIEF questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) on sildenafil compared to placebo. On a global improvement question, 57% of sildenafil patients reported improved erections versus 10% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on sildenafil, 48% of intercourse attempts were successful versus 12% on placebo. One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, flexible-dose (up to 100 mg) study of patients with erectile dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury (n=178) was conducted. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of sildenafil. On a global improvement question, 83% of patients reported improved erections on sildenafil versus 12% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on sildenafil, 59% of attempts at sexual intercourse were successful compared to 13% on placebo. Across all trials, sildenafil improved the erections of 43% of radical prostatectomy patients compared to 15% on placebo. Subgroup analyses of responses to a global improvement question in patients with psychogenic etiology in two fixed-dose studies (total n=179) and two titration studies (total n=149) showed 84% of sildenafil patients reported improvement in erections compared with 26% of placebo. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of sildenafil. Diary data in two of the studies (n=178) showed rates of successful intercourse per attempt of 70% for sildenafil and 29% for placebo. Efficacy Results in Subpopulations in Controlled Clinical Studies A review of population subgroups demonstrated efficacy regardless of baseline severity, etiology, race and age. Sildenafil was effective in a broad range of ED patients, including those with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, other cardiac disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and spinal cord injury, and in patients taking antidepressants/antipsychotics and anti-hypertensives/diuretics. sildenafil-citrate-figure-6 sildenafil-citrate-figure-7']",[],"['16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Sildenafil tablets USP are supplied as pale blue to blue, caplet shaped film-coated tablets containing sildenafil citrate equivalent to the nominally indicated amount of sildenafil as follows: For 25 mg - Pale blue to blue, round film-coated tablets, debossed with “25” on one side and “SL” on other side.

Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil with use of guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat [ see Contraindications (4.3) ]. Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure Physicians should advise patients of the potential for sildenafil to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications. Concomitant administration of sildenafil and an alpha - blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when sildenafil is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Cardiovascular Considerations Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, dizziness, nausea) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Sudden Loss of Vision Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including possible permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely post-marketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Physicians should discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION among the general population in patients with a “crowded” optic disc, although evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitor, including sildenafil, for this uncommon condition [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Priapism Physicians should warn patients that prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of sildenafil. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may result [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Avoid Use with other PDE5 Inhibitors Physicians should inform patients not to take sildenafil tablets with other PDE5 inhibitors including REVATIO or other pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatments containing sildenafil. Sildenafil is also marketed as REVATIO for the treatment of PAH. The safety and efficacy of sildenafil tablets with other PDE5 inhibitors, including REVATIO, have not been studied [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ].

Sildenafil tablets can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly to an unsafe level if it is taken with certain other medicines . Do not take sildenafil tablets if you take any other medicines called “nitrates.” Nitrates are used to treat chest pain (angina). A sudden drop in blood pressure can cause you to feel dizzy, faint, or have a heart attack or stroke. Do not take sildenafil tablets if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators which include: • Riociguat (Adempas ® ) a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic\xad-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Tell all your healthcare providers that you take sildenafil tablets. If you need emergency medical care for a heart problem, it will be important for your healthcare provider to know when you last took sildenafil tablets. Stop sexual activity and get medical help right away if you get symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex. Sexual activity can put an extra strain on your heart, especially if your heart is already weak from a heart attack or heart disease. Ask your doctor if your heart is healthy enough to handle the extra strain of having sex. Sildenafil tablets does not protect you or your partner from getting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-the virus that causes AIDS. What are sildenafil tablets? Sildenafil tablets are a prescription medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). You will not get an erection just by taking this medicine. Sildenafil tablets helps a man with erectile dysfunction get and keep an erection only when he is sexually excited (stimulated). Sildenafil tablets are not for use in women or children. It is not known if sildenafil tablets are safe and effective in women or children under 18 years of age. Who should not take sildenafil tablets? Do not take sildenafil tablets if you: take medicines called nitrates (such as nitroglycerin) use street drugs called “poppers” such as amyl nitrate or amyl nitrite, and butyl nitrate take any medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat (Adempas) are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in sildenafil tablets and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in sildenafil tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in sildenafil tablets. What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking sildenafil tablets? Before you take sildenafil tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have or have had heart problems such as a heart attack, irregular heartbeat, angina, chest pain, narrowing of the aortic valve or heart failure have had heart surgery within the last 6 months have pulmonary hypertension have had a stroke have low blood pressure, or high blood pressure that is not controlled have a deformed penis shape have had an erection that lasted for more than 4 hours have problems with your blood cells such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia have retinitis pigmentosa, a rare genetic (runs in families) eye disease have ever had severe vision loss, including an eye problem called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have bleeding problems have or have had stomach ulcers have liver problems have kidney problems or are having kidney dialysis have any other medical conditions Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take*, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Sildenafil tablets may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect the way sildenafil tablets works causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take any of the following: medicines called nitrates (see “What is the most important information I should know about sildenafil tablets?” ) medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat (Adempas) medicines called alpha blockers such as Hytrin (terazosin HCl), Flomax (tamsulosin HCl), Cardura (doxazosin mesylate), Minipress (prazosin HCl), Uroxatral (alfuzosin HCl), Jalyn (dutasteride and tamsulosin HCl), or Rapaflo (silodosin). Alpha-blockers are sometimes prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure. In some patients, the use of sildenafil tablets with alpha-blockers can lead to a drop in blood pressure or to fainting. medicines called HIV protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), saquinavir (Fortovase or Invirase) or atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz) some types of oral antifungal medicines, such as ketoconazole (Nizoral), and itraconazole (Sporanox) some types of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin (Biaxin), telithromycin (Ketek), or erythromycin other medicines that treat high blood pressure other medicines or treatments for ED Sildenafil tablets contains sildenafil, which is the same medicine found in another drug called REVATIO. REVATIO is used to treat a rare disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sildenafil tablets should not be used with REVATIO or with other PAH treatments containing sildenafil or any other PDE5 inhibitors (such as Adcirca [tadalafil]). Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines, if you are not sure. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take sildenafil tablets? Take sildenafil tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much sildenafil tablets to take and when to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Take sildenafil tablets about 1 hour before sexual activity. You may take sildenafil tablets between 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity if needed. Sildenafil tablets can be taken with or without food. If you take sildenafil tablets after a high fat meal (such as a cheeseburger and french fries), sildenafil tablets may take a little longer to start working Do not take sildenafil tablets more than 1 time a day. If you accidentally take too much sildenafil, call your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What are the possible side effects of sildenafil tablets? Sildenafil tablets can cause serious side effects. Rarely reported side effects include: an erection that will not go away (priapism). If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. If it is not treated right away, priapism can permanently damage your penis. sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. Sudden vision loss in one or both eyes can be a sign of a serious eye problem called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). It is uncertain whether PDE5 inhibitors directly cause the vision loss. Stop taking sildenafil tablets and call your healthcare provider right away if you have sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. sudden hearing decrease or hearing loss . Some people may also have ringing in their ears (tinnitus) or dizziness. If you have these symptoms, stop taking sildenafil tablets and contact a doctor right away. The most common side effects of sildenafil tablets are: headache flushing upset stomach abnormal vision, such as changes in color vision (such as having a blue color tinge) and blurred vision stuffy or runny nose back pain muscle pain nausea dizziness rash In addition, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeats and death have happened rarely in men taking sildenafil tablets. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking sildenafil tablets. It is not known if sildenafil tablets caused these problems. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of sildenafil tablets.

( 5.11 ) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Use caution when operating machinery. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in the drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. REXULTI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis without agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients 24 years of age and younger was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in Table 2 . No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide. Table 2 Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric REXULTI is not approved in pediatric patients with MDD. and Adult Patients Age Range (years) Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional patients 18 to 24 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer patient ≥65 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing REXULTI, in patients whose depression is persistently worse or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. REXULTI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis without agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including REXULTI. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue REXULTI and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drugs differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase as the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose increases. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Given these considerations, REXULTI should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment needed to produce a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with REXULTI, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with REXULTI despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.6 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including REXULTI, have caused metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. Although all of the drugs in the class to date have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with diabetic ketoacidosis hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with REXULTI. Assess fasting plasma glucose before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication and monitor periodically during long-term treatment. Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with MDD, the proportions of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) and borderline (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with REXULTI and placebo. In the long-term, open-label depression studies, 5% of adult patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift to high while taking REXULTI plus an antidepressant (ADT); 25% of patients with borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high. Combined, 9% of patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during the long-term depression studies. Schizophrenia (Adults): In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with schizophrenia, the proportions of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) or borderline (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with REXULTI and placebo. In the long-term, open-label schizophrenia studies, 8% of adult patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift from normal to high while taking REXULTI; 17% of patients with borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts from borderline to high. Combined, 10% of patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during the long-term schizophrenia studies. Schizophrenia Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years of age): In the long-term, open-label study in pediatric patients with schizophrenia, 2.7% of pediatric patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) while taking REXULTI. Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease: In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies in patients (51 to 90 years of age) with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the proportions of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) or impaired (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high were similar in patients treated with REXULTI (14%) and patients treated with placebo (16%). Of the patients who were previously treated with REXULTI for 12-weeks and continued into a 12-week, active-treatment extension study, 15% of patients with normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) fasting glucose while taking REXULTI; 30% of patients with impaired fasting glucose experienced shifts from impaired fasting glucose (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high fasting glucose. Combined, 20% of patients with normal or impaired fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose. Dyslipidemia Atypical antipsychotics cause adverse alterations in lipids. Before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication, obtain a fasting lipid profile at baseline and monitor periodically during treatment. Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with MDD, changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were similar in REXULTI- and placebo-treated patients. Table 3 shows the proportions of patients with changes in fasting triglycerides.

Of patients with normal baseline triglycerides, 17% experienced shifts to high, and 0.2% experienced shifts to very high. Combined, 0.6% of patients with normal or borderline fasting triglycerides experienced shifts to very high fasting triglycerides during the long-term depression studies. Schizophrenia (Adults): In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with schizophrenia, changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were similar in REXULTI- and placebo-treated patients.

Of patients with normal baseline triglycerides, 13% experienced shifts to high, and 0.4% experienced shifts to very high triglycerides. Combined, 0.6% of patients with normal or borderline fasting triglycerides experienced shifts to very high fasting triglycerides during the long-term schizophrenia studies. Schizophrenia [Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years of age)]: In the long-term, open-label study in pediatric patients with schizophrenia, shifts in baseline fasting total cholesterol from normal to high (<170 to ≥200 mg/dL) were reported in 7% of patients taking REXULTI, and shifts in baseline HDL cholesterol from normal to low (≥40 to <40 mg/dL) were reported in 12.9% of patients taking REXULTI. Of patients with normal baseline triglycerides, 8.5% experienced shifts from normal to high (<150 to ≥200 mg/dL). Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease: In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients (55 to 90 years of age) with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, changes in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were similar in REXULTI- and placebo-treated patients. Table 5 shows the proportions of patients with changes in fasting triglycerides in REXULTI- and placebo-treated patients.

Of the patients with normal baseline triglycerides, 18% experienced shifts from normal (<150 mg/dL) to high (200 to <500 mg/dL). Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including REXULTI. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter. Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: Table 6 shows weight gain data at last visit and percentage of adult patients with ≥7% increase in body weight at endpoint from the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients with MDD.

REXULTI was associated with mean change from baseline in weight of 2.9 kg at Week 26 and 3.1 kg at Week 52. In the long-term, open-label depression studies, 30% of patients demonstrated a ≥7% increase in body weight, and 4% demonstrated a ≥7% decrease in body weight. Schizophrenia ( Adults): Table 7 shows weight gain data at last visit and percentage of adult patients with ≥7% increase in body weight at endpoint from the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in adult patients with schizophrenia.

REXULTI was associated with mean change from baseline in weight of 1.3 kg at Week 26 and 2.0 kg at Week 52. In the long-term, open label schizophrenia studies, 20% of patients demonstrated a ≥7% increase in body weight, and 10% demonstrated a ≥7% decrease in body weight. Schizophrenia [Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years of age)]: In the long-term, open label study in pediatric patients with schizophrenia, 0.5% of patients discontinued due to weight increase. The mean increase in weight from the open-label study baseline to last visit was 3.8 kg. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for natural growth of children and adolescents by comparisons to age- and gender- matched population standards. A z-score change <0.5 SD is considered not clinically significant. In this study, the mean change in z-score from open-label baseline to last visit was 0.10 SD for body weight, while 20% of patients had an increase in age-and-gender-adjusted body weight z-score of at least 0.5 SD from baseline. When treating pediatric, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth. Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease: In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients (51 to 90 years of age) with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the proportion of the patients with a ≥7% increase in body weight (kg) at any visit were 2% in REXULTI compared to 0% in placebo group. In patients who were previously treated with REXULTI for 12 weeks and who continued into a 12-week, active-treatment extension study, there was no mean change in weight (kg) from baseline to last visit in association with REXULTI. In this extension study, 4% of patients demonstrated ≥7% increase in body weight, and 5% demonstrated a ≥7% decrease in body weight from baseline to last visit. 5.7 Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking REXULTI. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include sexual urges, shopping, eating, or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with REXULTI. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced, or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges. 5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in this class. Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of REXULTI at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue REXULTI in patients with absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 and follow their WBC until recovery. 5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In the short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of REXULTI plus ADT in adult patients with MDD, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients compared to placebo plus ADT-treated patients included: dizziness (2% versus 2%) and orthostatic hypotension (0.1% versus 0%). In the short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies of REXULTI in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in REXULTI-treated patients compared to placebo patients included: dizziness (2% versus 2%), orthostatic hypotension (0.4% versus 0.2%), and syncope (0.1% versus 0%). In 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies of REXULTI in patients with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, the incidence of orthostatic hypotension-related adverse reactions in patients treated with REXULTI compared to patients treated with placebo included: dizziness (3% versus 3%), orthostatic hypotension (1% versus 1%), and syncope (0.2% versus 0.8%). Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g., elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medication), patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. REXULTI has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease. Such patients were excluded from the premarketing clinical studies. 5.10 Falls Antipsychotics, including REXULTI, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor, and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic treatment. 5.11 Seizures Like other antipsychotic drugs, REXULTI may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in older patients. 5.12 Body Temperature Dysregulation Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body's ability to reduce core body temperature. Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use REXULTI with caution in patients who may experience these conditions. 5.13 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Antipsychotic drugs, including REXULTI, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration. 5.14 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment REXULTI, like other antipsychotics, may cause somnolence and has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. In the 6-week placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with MDD, somnolence (including sedation and hypersomnia) was reported in 4% of REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo plus ADT-treated patients. In the 6-week placebo-controlled clinical studies in adult patients with schizophrenia, somnolence (including sedation and hypersomnia) was reported in 5% of REXULTI-treated patients compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients (51 to 90 years of age) with agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, somnolence (including sedation) was reported in 3% of patients treated with REXULTI compared to 1% of patients treated with placebo. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that REXULTI therapy does not affect them adversely.""]","[""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Metabolic Changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Falls [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Body Temperature Dysregulation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Dysphagia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] Most common adverse reactions in adults were ( 6.1 ): MDD : Weight increased, somnolence, and akathisia (≥5% and at least twice the rate for placebo) Schizophrenia : Weight increased (≥4% and at least twice the rate for placebo) Agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease: Nasopharyngitis, dizziness (≥4% and at least twice the rate for placebo) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-438-9927 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adjunctive Treatment in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) The safety of REXULTI was evaluated in 1054 adult patients (18 to 65 years of age) diagnosed with MDD who participated in two 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients with major depressive disorder in which REXULTI was administered at doses of 1 mg to 3 mg daily as adjunctive treatment to continued antidepressant therapy; patients in the placebo group continued to receive antidepressant therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment A total of 3% (17/643) of REXULTI-treated patients and 1% (3/411) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions in REXULTI Studies for Adjunctive MDD in Adults Adverse reactions associated with the adjunctive use of REXULTI (incidence of 2% or greater and adjunctive REXULTI incidence greater than adjunctive placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6-weeks in patients with MDD) are shown in Table 8.

Schizophrenia Adults The safety of REXULTI was evaluated in 852 adult patients (18 to 65 years of age) diagnosed with schizophrenia who participated in two 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in which REXULTI was administered at daily doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Patients Treated with REXULTI for Schizophrenia Adverse reactions associated with REXULTI (incidence of 2% or greater and REXULTI incidence greater than placebo) during short-term (up to 6 weeks) studies in adult patients with schizophrenia are shown in Table 9.

Discontinuation of Treatment Due to Adverse Reactions In two 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, clinical studies, a total of 5.6% (28/503) of patients treated with REXULTI and 4.8% (12/251) of patients treated with placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Patients Treated with REXULTI for Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease Adverse reactions associated with REXULTI (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) during the 12-week fixed-dose clinical studies in geriatric patients for treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease are shown in Table 10.

The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients was 9% versus 2% for placebo plus ADT-treated patients. In the 6-week placebo-controlled MDD studies, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Score (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients versus placebo plus ADT-treated patients for the BARS (4% versus 0.6%) and the SAS (4% versus 3%). Schizophrenia The incidence of reported EPS-related adverse reactions, excluding akathisia, was 5% for REXULTI-treated patients versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI-treated patients was 6% versus 5% for placebo-treated patients. In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose schizophrenia studies in adults, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI-treated patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI-treated patients versus placebo for the BARS (2% versus 1%) and the SAS (7% versus 5%). Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease The incidence of reported EPS-related adverse reactions, excluding akathisia, was 3% for REXULTI-treated patients versus 2% for placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI-treated patients was 1% versus 0% for placebo-treated patients. In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies in agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI-treated patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI-treated patients versus placebo for the SAS (6% versus 2%). Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Other Adverse Reactions Observed during Clinical Trial Evaluation of REXULTI Other adverse reactions (≥1% frequency and greater than placebo) within the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with MDD and schizophrenia are shown below. The following listing does not include adverse reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have clinically significant implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Eye Disorders: Vision Blurred Gastrointestinal Disorders: Nausea, Dry Mouth, Salivary Hypersecretion, Abdominal Pain, Flatulence Investigations: Blood Prolactin Increased Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Psychiatric Disorders: Abnormal Dreams Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Hyperhidrosis Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years of age) In an on-going, 2 year, open-label study in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia, in which safety was assessed in 194 patients of which 140 received REXULTI for at least 6 months. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies for this age group were generally similar to those observed in adult patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of REXULTI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

REXULTI may be administered without dosage adjustment in patients with MDD when administered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine). or CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer half of recommended dosage. Strong/moderate CYP2D6 with Strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of the recommended dosage. Known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of the recommended dosage. Strong CYP3A4 inducers Double the recommended dosage and further adjust based on clinical response. 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with REXULTI See Table 11 for clinically important drug interactions with REXULTI. Table 11 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with REXULTI Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors In the clinical studies examining the adjunctive use of REXULTI in the treatment of MDD, dosage was not adjusted for strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine). Thus, CYP considerations are already factored into general dosing recommendations, and REXULTI may be administered without dosage adjustment in patients with MDD. Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, reduce the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Both CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP2D6 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI with 1) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 2) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 3) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 4) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor increased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with 1) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 2) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 3) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 4) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, decrease the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI and a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer, increase the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with REXULTI Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of REXULTI is required when administered concomitantly with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine) or gastric pH modifiers (e.g., omeprazole). Additionally, no dosage adjustment for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan), CYP3A4 (e.g., lovastatin), CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropion), BCRP (e.g., rosuvastatin), or P-gp (e.g., fexofenadine) is required when administered concomitantly with REXULTI.']","[""8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to REXULTI during pregnancy. For more information contact the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visit http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/ . Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been conducted with REXULTI in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. However, neonates whose mothers are exposed to antipsychotic drugs, like REXULTI, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. In animal reproduction studies, no teratogenicity was observed with oral administration of brexpiprazole to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 73 and 146 times, respectively, of maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. However, when pregnant rats were administered brexpiprazole during the period of organogenesis through lactation, the number of perinatal deaths of pups was increased at 73 times the MRHD [see Data ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder, have been reported in neonates whose mothers were exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (7.3, 24, and 73 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) of brexpiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Brexpiprazole was not teratogenic and did not cause adverse developmental effects at doses up to 73 times the MRHD. Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 10, 30, and 150 mg/kg/day (49, 146, and 730 times the MRHD) of brexpiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Brexpiprazole was not teratogenic and did not cause adverse developmental effects at doses up to 146 times the MRHD. Findings of decreased body weight, retarded ossification, and increased incidences of visceral and skeletal variations were observed in fetuses at 730 times the MRHD, a dose that induced maternal toxicity. In a study in which pregnant rats were administered oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day (7.3, 24, and 73 times the MRHD) during the period of organogenesis and through lactation, the number of live-born pups was decreased, and early postnatal deaths increased at a dose 73 times the MRHD. Impaired nursing by dams, and low birth weight and decreased body weight gain in pups were observed at 73 times, but not at 24 times, the MRHD. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of brexpiprazole in human milk, the effects of brexpiprazole on the breastfed infant, or the effects of brexpiprazole on milk production. Brexpiprazole is present in rat milk. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for REXULTI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from REXULTI or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Schizophrenia The safety and effectiveness of REXULTI for treatment of schizophrenia have been established in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. Use of REXULTI in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with schizophrenia, pharmacokinetic data from adults and pediatric patients, and safety data in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of REXULTI for the treatment of schizophrenia have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age. Major Depressive Disorder The safety and effectiveness of REXULTI for treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients. Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Irritability Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder The safety and effectiveness of REXULTI for the treatment of irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness was not demonstrated, in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose clinical study conducted in 119 REXULTI-treated pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 th Edition [DSM-5] criteria. In this study, somnolence (including sedation) occurred at a higher rate than reported in other REXULTI studies evaluating adults and elderly patients (16% in REXULTI-treated pediatric patients versus 5% for placebo). The mean increase in age-and-gender adjusted body weight z-score from baseline to last visit was 0.3 for REXULTI-treated patients versus 0.1 for placebo-treated patients. Increases in age-and-gender adjusted body weight z-score of at least 0.5 SD from baseline was higher in REXULTI-treated patients versus placebo (19% versus 5%). Of the 119 patients from this study, 95 patients entered the open-label treatment study and received up to 26 weeks of daily treatment with brexpiprazole. During the open-label treatment period, 2% of patients discontinued due to weight increase. In patients previously treated with REXULTI for 8 weeks, the mean increase in weight from the open-label study baseline to last visit was 4.5 kg. and 26% of patients had an increase in age-and-gender-adjusted body weight z-score of at least 0.5 SD from baseline. Juvenile Animal Studies Juvenile rats were administered oral doses of brexpiprazole of 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day once daily beginning from weaning (postnatal day 21) through adulthood (postnatal day 90), followed by a 4-week recovery (non-dosing) period. Results were similar to those observed in previous repeat‑dose toxicity studies in adolescent (8-week-old) rats. Mortality occurred at the high-dose of 20 mg/kg/day, as well as delayed sexual maturation in males and decreased rearing and motor activity. There was no evidence of neurotoxicity or effects on fertility and reproductive function. Histopathologic changes in reproductive organs and mammary glands occurred at all doses, were related to the pharmacology of brexpiprazole and were comparable to those in adult rats. All findings were at least partially reversible. Juvenile dogs were administered oral doses of brexpiprazole of 1, 3, and 30 mg/kg/day once daily starting at 8 or 9 weeks of age for 26 weeks, followed by an 8-week recovery (non-dosing) period. Decreases in body weight, lethargy, changes in heart rate, and immature male sex organs were observed at 30 mg/kg/day. These findings were at least partially reversible. 8.5 Geriatric Use Antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. REXULTI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Schizophrenia Of the total number of REXULTI-treated patients in the clinical studies for the adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for MDD and for schizophrenia, 248 (3%) were 65 years of age and older (which included 45 (18%) patients who were 75 years of age and older). Clinical studies of REXULTI in these patients did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. In general, dosage selection for the treatment of MDD or schizophrenia in a geriatric patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, and cardiac function, concomitant diseases, and other drug therapy. Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease The total number of REXULTI-treated patients 65 years of age and older in the clinical studies for agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (Studies 6 and 7) was 448 (86%) including 170 (33%) patients 65 to 74 years of age, 228 (44%) patients 75 to 84 years of age, and 50 (10%) patients 85 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . In clinical studies of REXULTI for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease did not include sufficient numbers of younger adult patients to determine if patients 65 years of age and older respond differently than younger adult patients. 8.6 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers Dosage adjustment is recommended in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers because these patients have higher brexpiprazole concentrations than normal metabolizers of CYP2D6. Approximately 8% of Caucasians and 3 to 8% of Black/African Americans cannot metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The maximum recommended dosage in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥7) is lower than those with mild hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment generally had higher exposure to brexpiprazole than patients with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Greater exposure may increase the risk of REXULTI-associated adverse reactions . 8.8 Renal Impairment The maximum recommended dosage in patients with CrCl<60 mL/minute is lower than those with mild renal impairment and those with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Patients with renal impairment had higher exposure to brexpiprazole than patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Greater exposure may increase the risk of REXULTI-associated adverse reactions. 8.9 Other Specific Populations The recommended dosage for REXULTI is the same in males and females, in different racial groups, and in smokers and nonsmokers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .""]","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to REXULTI during pregnancy.

Chemical Structure']","[""12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of REXULTI in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, or treatment of schizophrenia is unknown. However, the efficacy of REXULTI may be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at serotonin 5-HT 1A and dopamine D 2 receptors, and antagonist activity at serotonin 5-HT 2A receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Brexpiprazole has affinity (expressed as K i ) for multiple monoaminergic receptors including serotonin 5-HT 1A (0.12 nM), 5-HT 2A (0.47 nM), 5-HT 2B (1.9 nM), 5-HT 7 (3.7 nM), dopamine D 2 (0.30 nM), D 3 (1.1 nM), and noradrenergic α 1A (3.8 nM), α 1B (0.17 nM), α 1D (2.6 nM), and α 2C (0.59 nM) receptors. Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT 1A , D 2 , and D 3 receptors and as an antagonist at 5-HT 2A , 5-HT 2B , 5-HT 7 , α 1A , α 1B , α 1D , and α 2C receptors. Brexpiprazole also exhibits affinity for histamine H 1 receptor (19 nM) and for muscarinic M 1 receptor (67% inhibition at 10 µM). Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 3 times the MRHD for the treatment of schizophrenia and 4 times the MRHD for adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD or agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, REXULTI does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After single-dose administration of REXULTI tablets, the peak plasma brexpiprazole concentrations occurred within 4 hours after administration, and the absolute oral bioavailability was 95%. Brexpiprazole steady-state concentrations were attained within 10 to 12 days of dosing. REXULTI can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 4 mg REXULTI tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C max or AUC of brexpiprazole. After single and multiple once daily dose administration, brexpiprazole exposure (C max and AUC) increased in proportion to the dose administered. In vitro studies of brexpiprazole did not indicate that brexpiprazole is a substrate of efflux transporters such as MDRI (P-gp) and BCRP. Distribution The volume of distribution of brexpiprazole following intravenous administration is high (1.56 ± 0.42 L/kg), indicating extravascular distribution. Brexpiprazole is highly protein bound in plasma (greater than 99%) to serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, and its protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. Based on results of in vitro studies, brexpiprazole protein binding is not affected by warfarin, diazepam, or digitoxin. Elimination Metabolism Based on in vitro metabolism studies of brexpiprazole using recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4), the metabolism of brexpiprazole was shown to be mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. In vivo brexpiprazole is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. After single- and multiple-dose administrations, brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, were the predominant drug moieties in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, DM-3411 represented 23% to 48% of brexpiprazole exposure (AUC) in plasma. DM-3411 is considered not to contribute to the therapeutic effects of brexpiprazole. Based on in vitro data, brexpiprazole showed little to no inhibition of CYP450 isozymes. Excretion Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C]-labeled brexpiprazole, approximately 25% and 46% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged brexpiprazole was excreted in the urine, and approximately 14% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces. Apparent oral clearance of a brexpiprazole oral tablet after once daily administration is 19.8 (±11.4) mL/h/kg. After multiple once-daily administrations of REXULTI, the terminal elimination half-lives of brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, were 91 hours and 86 hours, respectively. Studies in Specific Populations Exposure of brexpiprazole in specific populations are summarized in Figure 1. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis indicated exposure of brexpiprazole in patients with moderate renal impairment was higher compared to patients with normal renal function. Figure 1 Effect of Intrinsic Factors on Brexpiprazole Pharmacokinetics Figure 1 Pediatric Patients A multiple dose PK study (0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day) has been conducted in 43 pediatric patients aged 13 years to 17 years old. Population PK analysis indicated systemic exposure (C max and AUC) of brexpiprazole in pediatric patients (13 to 17 years of age) was comparable to that in adult patients across the dose range from 0.5 to 4 mg. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of other drugs on the exposures of brexpiprazole are summarized in Figure 2. Based on simulation, a 5.1-fold increase in AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. A 4.8-fold increase in mean AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Figure 2 The Effect of Other Drugs on Brexpiprazole Pharmacokinetics The effect of REXULTI on the exposures of other drugs are summarized in Figure 3 . Figure 3 The Effect of REXULTI on Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Figure 2 Figure 3""]",[],[],[],"['13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice and Sprague Dawley rats. Brexpiprazole was administered orally for two years to male and female mice at doses of 0.75, 2, and 5 mg/kg/day (0.9 to 6.1 times the oral MRHD of 4 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area) and to male and female rats at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg and 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively (2.4 to 24 and 7.3 to 73 times the oral MRHD, males and females). In female mice, the incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinoma was increased at all doses, and the incidence of adenosquamous carcinoma was increased at 2.4 and 6.1 times the MRHD. No increase in the incidence of tumors was observed in male mice. In the rat study, brexpiprazole was not carcinogenic in either sex at doses up to 73 times the MRHD. Proliferative and/or neoplastic changes in the mammary and pituitary glands of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactin mediated. The potential for increasing serum prolactin level of brexpiprazole was shown in both mice and rats. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown. Mutagenesis Brexpiprazole was not mutagenic when tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). Brexpiprazole was negative for clastogenic activity in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats and was not genotoxic in the in vivo/in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. In vitro with mammalian cells brexpiprazole was clastogenic but only at doses that induced cytotoxicity. Based on a weight of evidence, brexpiprazole is not considered to present a genotoxic risk to humans. Impairment of Fertility Female rats were treated with oral doses of 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg/day (0.7, 7.3, and 73 times the oral MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) prior to mating with untreated males and continuing through conception and implantation. Estrus cycle irregularities and decreased fertility were observed at 3 and 30 mg/kg/day. Prolonged duration of pairing and increased preimplantation losses were observed at 30 mg/kg/day. Male rats were treated with oral doses of 3, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day (7.3, 24, and 240 times the oral MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) for 63 days prior to mating with untreated females and throughout the 14 days of mating. No differences were observed in the duration of mating or fertility indices in males at any dose of brexpiprazole.']",[],"[""14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of REXULTI in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) was evaluated in two 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies of adult patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD, with or without symptoms of anxiety, who had an inadequate response to prior antidepressant therapy (1 to 3 courses) in the current episode and who had also demonstrated an inadequate response throughout the 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant treatment (with escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled-release, sertraline, duloxetine delayed release, or venlafaxine extended release). Inadequate response during the prospective antidepressant treatment phase was defined as having persistent symptoms without substantial improvement throughout the course of treatment. Patients in Study 1 (NCT01360645) were randomized to REXULTI 2 mg once a day or placebo. Patients in Study 2 (NCT01360632) were randomized to REXULTI 1 or 3 mg once a day or placebo. For patients randomized to REXULTI, all patients initiated treatment at 0.5 mg once daily during Week 1. At Week 2, the REXULTI dosage was increased to 1 mg in all treatment groups, and either maintained at 1 mg or increased to 2 mg or 3 mg once daily, based on treatment assignment, from Week 3 onwards. The dosages were then maintained for the 4 remaining weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-related scale used to assess the degree of depressive symptomatology, with 0 representing no symptoms and 60 representing worst symptoms. At randomization, the mean MADRS total score was 27. In Studies 1 and 2, REXULTI (plus ADT) 2 mg once daily and 3 mg once daily were superior to placebo plus ADT in reducing mean MADRS total scores. Results from the primary efficacy parameters for both fixed dose studies are shown below in Table 12. Figure 4 below shows the time course of response based on the primary efficacy measure (MADRS) in Study 1.

Figure 4 Change from Baseline in MADRS Total Score by Study Visit (Week) in Patients with MDD in Adults (Study 1) Figure 4 14.2 Schizophrenia The efficacy of REXULTI in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia was demonstrated in two 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia. In both studies, Study 3 (NCT01396421) and Study 4 (NCT01393613), patients were randomized to REXULTI 2 or 4 mg once per day or placebo. Patients in the REXULTI groups initiated treatment at 1 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4. The REXULTI dosage was increased to 2 mg on Days 5 to 7. The dosage was then either maintained at 2 mg once daily or increased to 4 mg once daily, depending on treatment assignment, for the 5 remaining weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of both studies was the change from baseline to Week 6 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score. The PANSS is a 30-item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); the total PANSS scores range from 30 (best) to 210 (worst). In Study 3, REXULTI at both 2 mg once daily and 4 mg once daily was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score. In Study 4, REXULTI 4 mg once daily was superior to placebo on the PANSS total score (Table 13). Figure 5 shows the time course of response based on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in PANSS total score) in Study 3. Examination of population subgroups based on age, sex, and race did not suggest differential responsiveness.

Patients were stabilized for at least 12 weeks on 1 to 4 mg/day of REXULTI (N=202). They were then randomized in the double-blind treatment phase to either continue REXULTI at their achieved stable dose (N=97), or to switch to placebo (N=105). The primary endpoint in Study 5 was time from randomization to impending relapse during the double-blind phase, defined as: 1) Clinical Global Improvement score of ≥5 (minimally worse) and an increase to a score >4 on PANSS conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, or unusual thought content items, with either a ≥2 increase on a specific item or ≥4 point increase on the combined four PANSS items, 2) hospitalization due to worsening of psychotic symptoms, 3) current suicidal behavior, or 4) violent/aggressive behavior. A pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a statistically significantly longer time to relapse in patients randomized to the REXULTI group compared to placebo-treated patients. The study was subsequently terminated early because maintenance of efficacy had been demonstrated. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the cumulative proportion of patients with relapse during the double-blind treatment phase for REXULTI and placebo groups are shown in Figure 6. The key secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients who met the criteria for impending relapse, was statistically significantly lower in REXULTI-treated patients compared with placebo group. Figure 6 Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Percent Impending Relapse in Study 5 Note: A total of 202 patients were randomized. Among them, one patient in the placebo group did not take investigational medicinal product and one patient in the REXULTI group did not have post-randomization efficacy evaluations. These two patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Figure 5 Figure 6 14.3 Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease The efficacy of REXULTI in the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (Study 6, NCT01862640 and Study 7, NCT03548584). In these studies, patients were required to: Have a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, Have a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥5 and ≤22 and have a total score of ≥4 by the agitation/aggression item of the NPI/NPI-NH, and Exhibit sufficient agitation behaviors at time of entry to warrant use of pharmacotherapy, after excluding other factors. Patients in: Study 6 were randomized to an oral dosage of either REXULTI 1 mg once a day, REXULTI 2 mg once a day, or placebo. Patients in both REXULTI groups started on 0.25 mg once daily for approximately three days, then received 0.5 mg once daily for approximately 12 days. Subsequently, patients in the 1 mg group received 1 mg once daily for the remainder of the 12-week study, and patients in the 2 mg group received 1 mg once daily for approximately two weeks and then received 2 mg for the remainder of the study. Study 7 were randomized to an oral dose of either REXULTI 2 mg or 3 mg once a day (combined treatment arm) or placebo. Patients in both REXULTI groups started on 0.5 mg once daily for 7 days, then received 1 mg once daily for 7 days and then 2 mg once daily for 14 days. Subsequently, patients in the 2 mg group received 2 mg once daily for the remainder of the 12-week study, and patients in the 3 mg group received 3 mg once daily for the remainder of the study. Study 6 included 433 patients with a mean age of 74 years old, and a range of 51 and 90 years old; 45% were male; 96%, 3%, and 1%, were White, Black or African American, and Asian, respectively; and 16% and 83% were Latino/Hispanic and not Latino/Hispanic, respectively. Study 7 included 345 patients with a mean age of 74 years old, and a range of 56 and 90 years old; 44% were male; 95%, 4%, and 1% were White, Black or African American, and Asian, respectively; and 31% and 69% were Latino/Hispanic and not Latino/Hispanic, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint in these two studies was the change from baseline in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total (CMAI) score at Week 12. The CMAI is a clinician rated questionnaire consisting of 29 items, which assess the frequency of manifestations of agitated behaviors in elderly patients, based on caregiver input. Three specific factors can be derived from the CMAI scale: 1) Aggressive Behavior (e.g., screaming, throwing things, cursing/verbal aggression, kicking, pushing scratching, hurting self or others); 2) Physically Non-Aggressive Behavior (e.g., repetitive mannerisms, general restlessness, pacing); and 3) Verbally Agitated Behavior (e.g., complaining, repetitive questions, constant requests for attention). Each CMAI behavior was rated on a scale of 1 (never) to 7 (very frequent agitated behaviors); the total CMAI scores range from 29 (best) to 203 (worst). A negative change indicates improvement. In Trial 6, patients in the REXULTI 2 mg group showed improved total CMAI scores compared to patients in the placebo group at Week 12. In Trial 7, patients in the REXULTI 2 mg/3 mg group showed improved total CMAI scores compared to patients in the placebo group at Week 12. As shown in Table 14 and Figure 7, the mean change from baseline in the total CMAI score after 12 weeks in the 2 mg/or 3 mg REXULTI group was statistically significantly superior to the placebo group. The 1 mg REXULTI group did not demonstrate significantly greater mean changes at baseline from the placebo group in the total CMAI score in this patient population. The 1 mg once day REXULTI dosage is not approved and is not recommended for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Table 14: Change in CMAI Total Score In a supplementary analysis to examine the magnitude and direction of CMAI subscale response, Factor 1 (aggressive behavior), Factor 2 (physically non-aggressive behavior), and Factor 3 (verbal agitation) scores trended in the same direction with no single factor overly influencing the CMAI total score. from Baseline at Week 12 in Patients with Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease (Study 6 and Study 7) Study Treatment Group N Mean Baseline Score (SD) LS Mean Change from Baseline (SE) Placebo-subtracted Difference Difference (drug minus placebo) in least-squares mean change from baseline (95% CI) SD: standard deviation;

substance. 9.2 Abuse Animals given access to REXULTI did not self-administer the drug, suggesting that REXULTI does not have rewarding properties. 9.3 Dependence Humans and animals that received chronic REXULTI administration did not demonstrate any withdrawal signs upon drug discontinuation. This suggests that REXULTI does not produce physical dependence.']",[],[],[],"['10 OVERDOSAGE There is limited clinical trial experience regarding human overdosage with REXULTI. Management of a REXULTI overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. Consider contacting the Poison Help Line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. Oral activated charcoal and sorbitol (50 g/240 mL), administered one hour after ingesting oral REXULTI, decreased brexpiprazole C max and area under the curve (AUC) by approximately 5% to 23% and 31% to 39% respectively; however, there is insufficient information available on the therapeutic potential of activated charcoal in treating an overdose with REXULTI. There is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with REXULTI; hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful because brexpiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.']","['MEDICATION GUIDE REXULTI ® (REX-ul-TE) (brexpiprazole) tablets, for oral use This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting EMFLAZA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . 2.2 Dosing Information The recommended oral dosage of EMFLAZA is approximately 0.9 mg/kg/day once daily. If tablets are used, round up to the nearest possible dose. Any combination of the four EMFLAZA tablet strengths can be used to achieve this dose. If the oral suspension is used, round up to the nearest tenth of a milliliter (mL). 2.3 Discontinuation Dosage of EMFLAZA must be decreased gradually if the drug has been administered for more than a few days [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 2.4 Important Preparation and Administration Instructions EMFLAZA Tablets and Oral Suspension can be taken with or without food. Do not administer EMFLAZA with grapefruit juice [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] EMFLAZA Tablets EMFLAZA Tablets can be administered whole or crushed and taken immediately after mixing with applesauce. EMFLAZA Oral Suspension Shake EMFLAZA Oral Suspension well before administration. Use only the oral dispenser provided with the product. After withdrawing the appropriate dose into the oral dispenser, slowly add the EMFLAZA Oral Suspension into 3 to 4 ounces of juice (except grapefruit juice) or milk and mix well. The dose should then be administered immediately. Discard any unused EMFLAZA Oral Suspension remaining after 1 month of first opening the bottle. 2.5 Dosage Modification for Use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers CYP3A4 Inhibitors Give one third of the recommended dosage when EMFLAZA is administered with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Hypersensitivity to deflazacort or any of the inactive ingredients in EMFLAZA ( 4 )']","['5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Alterations in Endocrine Function: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, and hyperglycemia can occur; Monitor patients for these conditions with chronic use of EMFLAZA ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection: Increased risk of new, exacerbation, dissemination, or reactivation of latent infections, which can be severe and at times fatal; Signs and symptoms of infection may be masked ( 5.2 ) Alterations in Cardiovascular/Renal Function: Monitor for elevated blood pressure and sodium, and for decreased potassium levels ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal Perforation: Increased risk in patients with certain GI disorders; Signs and symptoms may be masked ( 5.4 ) Behavioral and Mood Disturbances: May include euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, severe depression, and psychosis ( 5.5 ) Effects on Bones: Monitor for decreases in bone mineral density with chronic use of EMFLAZA ( 5.6 ) Ophthalmic Effects: May include cataracts, infections, and glaucoma; Monitor intraocular pressure if EMFLAZA is continued for more than 6 weeks ( 5.7 ) Vaccination: Do not administer live or live attenuated vaccines to patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting EMFLAZA ( 5.8 ) Serious Skin Rashes: Discontinue at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function Corticosteroids, such as EMFLAZA, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving EMFLAZA for Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after EMFLAZA withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events. Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased. A steroid “withdrawal syndrome”, seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels. Cushing’s Syndrome Cushing’s syndrome (hypercortisolism) occurs with prolonged exposure to exogenous corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA. Symptoms include hypertension, truncal obesity and thinning of the limbs, purple striae, facial rounding, facial plethora, muscle weakness, easy and frequent bruising with thin fragile skin, posterior neck fat deposition, osteopenia, acne, amenorrhea, hirsutism and psychiatric abnormalities. Hyperglycemia Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose, worsen pre-existing diabetes, predispose those on long-term therapy to diabetes mellitus, and may reduce the effect of anti-diabetic drugs. Monitor blood glucose at regular intervals. For patients with hyperglycemia, anti-diabetic treatment should be initiated or adjusted accordingly. Considerations for Use in Patients with Altered Thyroid Function Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate a dose adjustment of the corticosteroid. When concomitant administration of corticosteroids and levothyroxine is required, administration of corticosteroid should precede the initiation of levothyroxine therapy to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis. Pheochromocytoma Crisis There have been reports of pheochromocytoma crisis, which can be fatal, after administration of systemic corticosteroids. In patients with suspected or identified pheochromocytoma, consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids. 5.2 Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic. Corticosteroids reduce resistance to new infections, exacerbate existing infections, increase the risk of disseminated infections, increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections, and mask some signs of infection. These infections can be severe, and at times fatal. The degree to which the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration correlates with the specific risks of infection is not well characterized; however, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases with increasing doses of corticosteroids. Monitor for the development of infection and consider withdrawal of corticosteroids or reduction of the dose of corticosteroids as needed. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Chickenpox caused by Varicella Zoster virus and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA. In children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers undergoing treatment with immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids. Reactivation can also occur in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections. For patients on corticosteroids who develop systemic fungal infections, withdrawal of corticosteroids or reduction of the dose of corticosteroids is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics, or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation In patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. For patients on corticosteroids who develop known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation, withdrawal of corticosteroids or reduction of the dose of corticosteroids is recommended. 5.3 Alterations in Cardiovascular/Renal Function Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt, and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium and calcium. Monitor blood pressure and assess for signs and symptoms of volume overload. Monitor serum potassium levels. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. EMFLAZA should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency. Literature reports suggest an association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with EMFLAZA should be used with great caution in these patients. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Perforation There is an increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation during corticosteroid use in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders such as active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and non-specific ulcerative colitis. Signs of gastrointestinal perforation, such as peritoneal irritation, may be masked in patients receiving corticosteroids. Avoid corticosteroids if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infections; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; or active or latent peptic ulcer. 5.5 Behavioral and Mood Disturbances Potentially severe psychiatric adverse reactions may occur with systemic corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA. Symptoms typically emerge within a few days or weeks of starting treatment and may be dose-related. These reactions may improve after either dose reduction or withdrawal, although pharmacologic treatment may be necessary. Psychiatric adverse reactions usually involve hypomanic or manic symptoms (e.g., euphoria, insomnia, mood swings) during treatment and depressive episodes after discontinuation of treatment. Inform patients or caregivers of the potential for behavioral and mood changes and encourage them to seek medical attention if psychiatric symptoms develop, especially if depressed mood or suicidal ideation is suspected. 5.6 Effects on Bones Decreased Bone Mineral Density Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of bone loss at any age. Bone loss can predispose patients to vertebral and long bone fractures. Consider a patient’s risk of osteoporosis before initiating corticosteroid therapy. Monitor bone mineral density in patients on long-term treatment with EMFLAZA. Avascular Necrosis Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, may cause avascular necrosis. 5.7 Ophthalmic Effects Use of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts. Corticosteroids may also cause glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may increase the risk of secondary ocular infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Corticosteroids are not recommended for patients with active ocular herpes simplex. Intraocular pressure may become elevated in some patients taking corticosteroids. If treatment with EMFLAZA is continued for more than 6 weeks, monitor intraocular pressure. 5.8 Immunizations Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to starting EMFLAZA. Administer live-attenuated or live vaccines at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to starting EMFLAZA. Patients on EMFLAZA may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live-attenuated or live vaccines. 5.9 Serious Skin Rashes Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with the use of deflazacort with symptoms beginning within 8 weeks of starting treatment. Discontinue at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. 5.10 Effects on Growth and Development Long-term use of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, can have negative effects on growth and development in children. 5.11 Myopathy Patients receiving corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, and concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium) or patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis) may be at increased risk of developing acute myopathy. This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years. 5.12 Kaposi’s Sarcoma Kaposi’s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement. 5.13 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants because of Benzyl Alcohol Preservative EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains benzyl alcohol and is not approved for use in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including EMFLAZA. The “gasping syndrome” is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing EMFLAZA Oral Suspension, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources, including EMFLAZA Oral Suspension (EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains 10.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL; EMFLAZA Tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. At the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg/day of EMFLAZA Oral Suspension, patients would receive approximately 0.4 mg/kg/day of benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.14 Thromboembolic Events Observational studies have shown an increased risk of thromboembolism (including venous thromboembolism) particularly with higher cumulative doses of corticosteroids. It is unclear if risk differs by daily dose or duration of use. Use EMFLAZA with caution in patients who have or may be predisposed to thromboembolic disorders. 5.15 Anaphylaxis Rare instances of anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, including EMFLAZA.']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections: Alterations in Endocrine Function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Alterations in Cardiovascular/Renal Function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Gastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Behavioral and Mood Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Effects on Bones [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Ophthalmic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Immunizations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Serious Skin Rashes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Effects on Growth and Development [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] Kaposi’s Sarcoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants because of Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )] The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% for EMFLAZA and greater than placebo) are Cushingoid appearance, weight increased, increased appetite, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pollakiuria, hirsutism, central obesity, and nasopharyngitis ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact PTC Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-866-562-4620 or Pharmacovigilance@PTCBio.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , the adverse reactions that were associated with deflazacort treatment discontinuation, in decreasing order of frequency, were weight increased, obesity, cataract, and sleep disorder. Most Common Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in the 0.9 mg/kg/day deflazacort-treated group and that occurred more frequently than in placebo patients in Study 1, which included patients with DMD between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Deflazacort-Treated Patients and Occurred More Frequently than in Placebo Patients with DMD (Study 1) 1 At 12 weeks placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or an active comparator.

Study 1 also evaluated a higher dosage of deflazacort (1.2 mg/kg/day). Compared with the 0.9 mg/kg/day dosage, deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day over 52 weeks was associated with a higher incidence of certain adverse reactions, including Cushingoid appearance (69%), erythema (49%), hirsutism (37%), headache (34%), weight increased (32%), constipation (15%), abdominal pain upper (14%), skin striae (11%), acne (11%), and abdominal discomfort (8%). As there was no additional benefit with the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose of deflazacort, use of EMFLAZA 1.2 mg/kg/day is not recommended for the treatment of DMD [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . In an additional clinical study of two years duration with extended follow-up (Study 2), many of the same adverse reactions were observed. In addition, musculoskeletal events associated with long-term steroid use were also observed, including muscle weakness, tendon disorder, and osteopenia. Less Common Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Other adverse reactions (≥ 1% frequency in any deflazacort treatment group and greater than placebo) that were observed during the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of Study 1 are shown below.

Avoid concomitant use of strong (e.g., efavirenz) or moderate (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin) CYP3A4 inducers with EMFLAZA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers Patients receiving corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, and concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium) may be at increased risk of developing an acute myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] .']","['8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born to mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with EMFLAZA in pregnant women to inform drug-associated risks. Corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, readily cross the placenta. Adverse developmental outcomes, including orofacial clefts (cleft lip, with or without cleft palate) and intrauterine growth restriction, and decreased birth weight, have been reported with maternal use of corticosteroids, including EMFLAZA, during pregnancy. Some epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of orofacial clefts from about 1 per 1000 infants to 3 to 5 per 1000 infants; however, a risk for orofacial clefts has not been observed in all studies. Intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight appear to be dose-related; however, the underlying maternal condition may also contribute to these risks (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with deflazacort. Animal reproduction studies conducted with other corticosteroids in pregnant mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits using clinically relevant doses have shown an increased incidence of cleft palate. An increase in embryofetal death, intrauterine growth retardation, and constriction of the ductus arteriosus were observed in some animal species. Data Human Data Multiple cohort and case-controlled studies in humans suggest that maternal corticosteroid use during the first trimester increases the rate of cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, from about 1/1000 infants to 3-5/1000 infants. Two prospective case-controlled studies showed decreased birth weight in infants exposed to maternal corticosteroids in utero. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for EMFLAZA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from EMFLAZA. There are no data on the effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EMFLAZA for the treatment of DMD have been established in patients 2 years of age and older. Use of EMFLAZA in pediatric patients is supported by a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study in 196 males 5 to 15 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Use of EMFLAZA in patients 2 years to less than 5 years of age is supported by the findings of efficacy and safety in patients 5 years and older with DMD. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains benzyl alcohol and is not approved for use in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and “gasping syndrome” occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. When prescribing EMFLAZA Oral Suspension consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including EMFLAZA Oral Suspension (EMFLAZA Oral Suspension contains 10.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL; EMFLAZA Tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. At the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg/day of EMFLAZA Oral Suspension, patients would receive approximately 0.4 mg/kg/day of benzyl alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Oral administration of deflazacort (0, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg/day) to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 21 to 80 resulted in decreased body weight gain and adverse effects on skeletal development (including decreased cellularity of growth plate and altered bone distribution) and on lymphoid tissue (decreased cellularity). A no-effect dose was not identified. In addition, neurological and neurobehavioral abnormalities were observed at the mid and/or high dose. Plasma 21-desDFZ exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg/day) was lower than that in humans at the recommended human dose of EMFLAZA (0.9 mg/kg/day). 8.5 Geriatric Use DMD is largely a disease of children and young adults; therefore, there is no geriatric experience with EMFLAZA. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .

The precise mechanism by which deflazacort exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with DMD is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration in the fasted state, the median T max with deflazacort tablets or suspension is about 1 hour (range 0.25 to 2 hours). Food Effect: Co-administration of deflazacort tablets with a high-fat meal reduced C max by about 30% and delayed T max by one hour, relative to administration under fasting conditions, but there was no effect on the overall systemic absorption as measured by AUC. The bioavailability of deflazacort tablets was similar to that of the oral suspension. The administration of deflazacort with food or crushed in applesauce did not affect the absorption and bioavailability of deflazacort. Distribution The protein binding of the active metabolite of deflazacort is about 40%. Elimination Metabolism Deflazacort is rapidly converted to the active metabolite 21-desDFZ by esterases after oral administration. 21-desDFZ is further metabolized by CYP3A4 to several other inactive metabolites, including 6β-hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort. Excretion Urinary excretion is the predominant route of deflazacort elimination (about 68% of the dose), and the elimination is almost completed by 24 hours post dose. 21-desDFZ accounts for 18% of the eliminated drug in the urine. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The C max values (Geometric mean, %CV) of 21-desDFZ in children (ages 4-11, N=16) and adolescents (ages 12-16, N=8) was 206 ng/mL (95.6%) and 381 ng/mL (37.7%), respectively, on Day 1 after administration of 0.9 mg/kg deflazacort. The AUC inf (Geometric mean, %CV) of 21-desDFZ in children (ages 4-11, N=16) and adolescents (ages 12-16, N=8) was 400 ng•h/mL (87.5%) and 655 ng•h/mL (58.1%) on Day 1 after administration of 0.9 mg/kg deflazacort. Male and Female Patients There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of 21-desDFZ between males and females. Racial or Ethnic Groups There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of 21-desDFZ between Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Patients with Renal Impairment In a study (N=16) comparing subjects with end stage renal disease (creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/min) with healthy matched controls, 21-desDFZ exposure was similar between the groups. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In a study (N=16) comparing subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) with healthy matched controls, 21-desDFZ exposure was similar between the groups. There is no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Compared to administration of deflazacort alone, administration of deflazacort following multiple doses of a strong CYP3A4 and Pgp inhibitor (clarithromycin) resulted in markedly higher C max , AUC last , and AUC inf values of 21-desDFZ. Geometric mean exposure (C max , AUC last , and AUC inf ) of 21-desDFZ ranged from 2.3-fold to 3.4-fold higher following administration of clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Compared to administration of deflazacort alone, administration of deflazacort following multiple doses of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) resulted in markedly lower C max , AUC last , and AUC inf values of 21-desDFZ. Geometric mean exposures (C max , AUC la st , and AUC inf ) of 21-desDFZ were approximately 95% lower following administration of rifampin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 6β-Hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort, a secondary and inactive metabolite, is not expected to cause any clinically meaningful interactions with the CYP enzymes or transporters. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Drug-Metabolizing Enzyme Inhibition 21-desDFZ at clinically relevant concentrations did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7 and exhibited weak and not likely clinically meaningful inhibition for 2B6, 2C8, 2D6, and 3A4, UGT1A3 and UGT2B15. 6β-Hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort at clinically relevant concentrations did not significantly inhibit CYP2C19, 3A4 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, or 2D6. Drug-Metabolizing Enzyme Induction 21-desDFZ and 6β-hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort at clinically relevant concentrations did not significantly induce CYP1A2, 2B6, or 3A4.

The study population consisted of 196 male pediatric patients 5 to 15 years of age with documented mutation of the dystrophin gene, onset of weakness before 5 years of age, and serum creatinine kinase activity at least 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at some stage in their illness. Patients were randomized to therapy with deflazacort (0.9 or 1.2 mg/kg/day), an active comparator, or placebo. A comparison to placebo was made after 12 weeks of treatment. After 12 weeks, placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or the active comparator; all patients continued treatment for an additional 40 weeks. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the treatment arms. In Study 1, efficacy was evaluated by assessing the change between Baseline and Week 12 in average strength of 18 muscle groups. Individual muscle strength was graded using a modified Medical Research Council (MRC) 11-point scale, with higher scores representing greater strength. The change in average muscle strength score between Baseline and Week 12 was significantly greater for the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day dose group than for the placebo group (see Table 2 ). Table 2: Analysis of Change from Baseline at Week 12 in Average Muscle Strength Score (Study 1) Treatment N Change from Baseline LS Mean (95% CI) P-value Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day 51 0.15 (0.01, 0.28) 0.017 Placebo 50 -0.10 (-0.23, 0.03) Compared with the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day group, the deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day group demonstrated a small additional benefit compared to placebo at Week 12, but had a greater incidence of adverse reactions. Therefore, use of a 1.2 mg/kg/day dosage of EMFLAZA is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Although not a pre-specified statistical analysis, compared with placebo, the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day dose group demonstrated at Week 52 the persistence of the treatment effect observed at Week 12 and the small advantage of the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose that was observed at Week 12 was no longer present. Also not statistically controlled for multiple comparisons, results on several timed measures of patient function (i.e., time to stand from supine, time to climb 4 stairs, and time to walk or run 30 feet) numerically favored deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day at Week 12, in comparison with placebo. An additional randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 104-week clinical trial evaluated deflazacort in comparison to placebo (Study 2). The study population consisted of 29 male children 6 to 12 years of age with a DMD diagnosis confirmed by the documented presence of abnormal dystrophin or a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene. The results of the analysis of the primary endpoint of average muscle strength scores in Study 2 (graded on a 0-5 scale) at 2 years were not statistically significant, possibly because of a limited number of patients remaining in the placebo arm (subjects were discontinued from the trial when they lost ambulation). Although not statistically controlled for multiple comparisons, average muscle strength scores at Months 6 and 12, as well as the average time to loss of ambulation, numerically favored deflazacort in comparison with placebo.']","['<table ID=""table01"" width=""600"" styleCode=""Noautorules""><caption>Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in &#x2265; 5% of Deflazacort-Treated Patients and Occurred More Frequently than in Placebo Patients with DMD (Study 1)</caption><col width=""34%"" align=""left""/><col width=""33%"" align=""center""/><col width=""33%"" align=""center""/><tfoot><tr><td colspan=""3"" align=""left""><paragraph styleCode=""footnote""><sup>1</sup> At 12 weeks placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or an active comparator.</paragraph></td></tr></tfoot><tbody><tr valign=""top""><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Lrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Adverse Reaction</content></td><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Deflazacort</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">0.9 mg/kg/d (N=51)</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">% at 12 weeks</content></td><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Placebo (N=50)</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">% at 12 weeks<sup>1</sup></content></td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Cushingoid appearance</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">33</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">12</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Weight increased</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">20</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">6</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Increased appetite</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">14</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Upper respiratory tract infection</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">12</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">10</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Cough</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">12</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">6</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Pollakiuria</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">12</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Nasopharyngitis</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">10</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">6</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Hirsutism</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">10</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Central obesity</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">10</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">4</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Erythema</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">8</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">6</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Irritability</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">8</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">4</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Rhinorrhea</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">8</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">0</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Abdominal discomfort</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">6</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2</td></tr></tbody></table>', '<table ID=""table02"" width=""600"" styleCode=""Noautorules""><caption>Table 2: Analysis of Change from Baseline at Week 12 in Average Muscle Strength Score (Study 1)</caption><col width=""38%"" align=""center""/><col width=""12%"" align=""center""/><col width=""33%"" align=""center""/><col width=""17%"" align=""center""/><tbody><tr valign=""top""><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Lrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Treatment</content></td><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">N</content></td><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Change from</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">Baseline</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">LS Mean (95% CI)</content></td><td styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">P-value</content></td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">51</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">0.15 (0.01, 0.28)</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">0.017</td></tr><tr><td styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Placebo</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">50</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">-0.10 (-0.23, 0.03)</td><td styleCode=""Botrule Rrule""/></tr></tbody></table>']","['16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING 16.1 How Supplied EMFLAZA Tablets 6 mg are white, round with “6” debossed on one side.

The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established. Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients, particularly in those at higher risk for mortality. ( 5.1 , 6.1 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia : The use of NUZYRA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.4 ). Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Mortality imbalance was observed in the CABP clinical trial with eight deaths (2%) occurring in patients treated with NUZYRA compared to four deaths (1%) in patients treated with moxifloxacin. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients > 65 years of age; most patients had multiple comorbidities [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients, particularly in those at higher risk for mortality [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of NUZYRA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the tetracycline class drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported with tetracycline class drugs. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if NUZYRA is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if NUZYRA is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ] . 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with NUZYRA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. NUZYRA is structurally similar to other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs [see Contraindications (4) ] . Discontinue NUZYRA if an allergic reaction occurs. 5.5 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Tetracycline Class Effects NUZYRA is structurally similar to tetracycline-class of antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions. Adverse reactions including photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, pancreatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, have been reported for other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, and may occur with NUZYRA. Discontinue NUZYRA if any of these adverse reactions are suspected. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing NUZYRA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Indications and Usage (1.3) ].']","[""6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of labeling: Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Tooth Development and Enamel Hypoplasia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Inhibition of Bone Growth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tetracycline Class Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are nausea, vomiting, infusion site reactions, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, hypertension, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, and constipation.

Overview of the Safety Evaluation of NUZYRA NUZYRA was evaluated in three Phase 3 clinical trials (Trial 1, Trial 2 and Trial 3). These trials included a single Phase 3 trial in CABP patients (Trial 1) and two Phase 3 trials in ABSSSI patients (Trial 2 and Trial 3). Across all Phase 3 trials, a total of 1073 patients were treated with NUZYRA (382 patients in Trial 1 and 691 in Trials 2 and 3 of which 368 patients were treated with only oral NUZYRA. Clinical Trial Experience in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Trial 1 was a Phase 3 CABP trial that enrolled 774 adult patients, 386 randomized to NUZYRA (382 received at least one dose of NUZYRA and 4 patients did not receive the study drug) and 388 randomized to moxifloxacin (all 388 received at least one dose of moxifloxacin). The mean age of patients treated with NUZYRA was 61 years (range 19 to 97 years) and 42% were greater than or equal to 65 years of age. Overall, patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (53.7%), white (92.4%), and had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.3 kg/m 2 . Approximately 47% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Patients were administered an IV to oral switch dosage regimen of NUZYRA. The total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. Mean duration of IV treatment was 5.7 days and mean total duration of treatment was 9.6 days in both treatment arms. Imbalance in Mortality In Trial 1, eight deaths (2%) occurred in 382 patients treated with NUZYRA as compared to four deaths (1%) in 388 patients treated with moxifloxacin. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients >65 years of age. The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In Trial 1, a total of 23/382 (6.0%) patients treated with NUZYRA and 26/388 (6.7%) patients treated with moxifloxacin experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reactions occurred in 21/382 (5.5%) patients treated with NUZYRA and 27/388 (7.0%) patients treated with moxifloxacin. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 lists the most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥2% of patients receiving NUZYRA in Trial 1.

Trial 3 was a Phase 3 ABSSSI trial that enrolled 735 adult patients, 368 randomized to NUZYRA and 367 randomized to linezolid. In Trial 2 (IV to oral switch trial), the mean age of patients treated with NUZYRA was 47 years (range 19 to 88). Overall, patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (62.8%), white (91.0%) and had a mean BMI of 28. kg/m 2 . In Trial 3 (oral only trial), the mean age of patients was 43 years (range 18 to 86). Patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (65.8%), white (88.9%), and had a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m 2 . In Trials 2 and 3, approximately 12% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Overall, the mean and median calculated lesion area was similar across both trials. Trial 2 required at least 3 days of IV treatment followed by switch to oral regimen based on physician's discretion. Mean duration of IV treatment in Trial 2 was 4 days and mean total duration of treatment was 9 days in both treatment arms. In Trial 3, only oral therapy was administered, and mean total duration of treatment was 8 days in both treatment arms. The median days on treatment in the pooled ABSSSI trials was 9 days for both NUZYRA and linezolid. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the pooled ABSSSI trials, serious adverse reactions occurred in 16/691 (2.3%) of patients treated with NUZYRA and 13/689 (1.9%) of patients treated with comparator. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 12 (1.7%) NUZYRA treated patients, and 10 (1.5%) comparator treated patients. There was 1 death (0.1%) reported in NUZYRA treated patients and 3 deaths (0.4%) reported in linezolid patients in ABSSSI trials.

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary NUZYRA, like other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, may cause discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimester of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) , Data , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. The limited available data of NUZYRA use in pregnant women is insufficient to inform drug associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriages. Animal studies indicate that administration of omadacycline during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal loss and/or congenital malformations in pregnant rats and rabbits at 7 times and 3 times the mean AUC exposure, respectively, of the clinical intravenous dose of 100-mg and the oral dose of 300-mg. Reductions in fetal weight occurred in rats at all administered doses (see Data ). In a fertility study, administration to rats during mating and early pregnancy resulted in embryo loss at 20 mg/kg/day; systemic exposure based on AUC was approximately equal to the clinical exposure level [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Results of studies in rats with omadacycline have shown tooth discoloration. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15-20%. Data Animal Data Intravenous infusion of omadacycline to pregnant rats during organogenesis (gestation days 6-17) at doses of 5 to 80 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal lethality at 80 mg/kg/day. Increased embryo-fetal lethality and fetal malformations (whole body edema) occurred at 60 mg/kg/day (7 times the clinical AUC), dose-dependent reductions in fetal body weight occurred at all doses, and delayed skeletal ossification occurred at doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day (Systemic exposure based on AUC at a similar dose in unmated female rats in a separate study was approximately half the clinical exposure). In pregnant rabbits, intravenous infusion of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (gestation days 7-18) resulted in maternal lethality and body weight loss at 20 mg/kg/day. Embryo-fetal lethality, congenital malformations of the skeleton, and reduced fetal weight also occurred at 20 mg/kg/day (7 times the clinical AUC). Cardiac and lung malformations were present in dose-related incidence at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day. The fetal no-adverse-effect-level in the rabbit embryo-fetal development study was 5 mg/kg/day, at approximately 1.2 times the clinical steady state AUC. Intravenous infusion of omadacycline to pregnant and lactating rats at doses of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day did not adversely affect survival, growth (other than lower pup body weights and/or gains at the high dose that were only statistically significant at sporadic intervals), postnatal development, behavior, or reproductive capability of offspring at maternal doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to 3 times the IV clinical dose of 100 mg/day, based on doses normalized for total body surface area), the highest dose tested, although dosing was discontinued early in a number of animals in this group due to injection site intolerance. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of omadacycline in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk; however, the extent of absorption of tetracyclines, including omadacycline, by the breastfed infant is not known. Because there are other antibacterial drug options available to treat CABP and ABSSSI in lactating women and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NUZYRA and for 4 days (based on half-life) after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females NUZYRA may produce embryonic or fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise patients to use an acceptable form of contraception while taking NUZYRA. Infertility Males In rat studies, injury to the testis and reduced sperm counts and motility occurred in male rats after treatment with omadacycline [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Females In rat studies, omadacycline affected fertility parameters in female rats, resulting in reduced ovulation and increased embryonic loss at intended human exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of NUZYRA in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Due to the adverse effects of the tetracycline-class of drugs, including NUZYRA on tooth development and bone growth, use of NUZYRA in pediatric patients less than 8 years of age is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients who received NUZYRA in the Phase 3 clinical trials (n=1073), 200 patients were ≥ 65 years of age, including 92 patients who were ≥75 years of age.

Additionally, all deaths in the CABP trial occurred in patients >65 years of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. No significant difference in NUZYRA exposure was observed between healthy elderly subjects and younger subjects following a single 100-mg IV dose of NUZYRA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of NUZYRA is warranted in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh classes A, B, or C) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of NUZYRA is warranted in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, including patients with end stage renal disease who are receiving hemodialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].']","['8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary NUZYRA, like other tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, may cause discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimester of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) , Data , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].

Chemical Structure']","['12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action NUZYRA is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4) ] 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Based on the nonclinical and clinical data, including electrocardiogram evaluation in the phase 3 clinical trials, one of which had moxifloxacin as a control group, no clinically relevant QTc prolongation was observed at the maximum recommended dose of omadacycline. Cardiac Physiology-Increase in Heart Rate In phase 1 studies conducted in healthy volunteers, reversible dose-dependent increases in heart rate have been observed following administration of single and multiple doses of omadacycline. The clinical implication of this finding is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In a standard radiolabeled ligand binding assays, omadacycline was shown to inhibit binding of H-scopolamine to the M2 subtype of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. In the heart, muscarinic M2 receptors serve as mediators of the parasympathetic input that normally is received via the vagus nerve and stimulation of the receptor increases membrane potassium conductance through the acetylcholine-dependent channel, which slows depolarization and reduces pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of NUZYRA after single and multiple oral and intravenous doses are summarized in Table 6 .

Effect of Food Ingestion of a standard high-fat nondairy meal (855 calories; 59% calories from fat) and standard high-fat meal including dairy (985 calories; 60% calories from fat) 2-hours before administration of a single 300-mg oral dose of NUZYRA decreased the rate (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC) by 40% and 42%, and 59% and 63%, respectively compared to administration of NUZYRA under fasting conditions. The rate and extent of absorption of NUZYRA were not substantially decreased when a high-fat nondairy meal (800-1000 calories; 50% calories from fat) was ingested 4 hours pre-dose. Following ingestion of either a light non-fat (300-350 calories; ≤5% calories from fat), or a standard low-fat (800-1000 calories; 30% calories from fat), or a standard high fat (800-1000 calories; 50% calories from fat) meal 2 hours post-dose, the AUC and C max were not substantially altered, as compared to fasting conditions. Distribution Plasma protein binding of omadacycline is approximately 20% and is not concentration dependent. The mean (% CV) volume of distribution of omadacycline at steady-state following IV administration of NUZYRA in healthy subjects was 190 (27.7) L. Elimination Renal clearance of omadacycline following IV administration of NUZYRA ranged from 2.4 to 3.3 L/h in healthy subjects. Metabolism In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes demonstrated that omadacycline is not metabolized. Excretion Following a 100-mg IV dose of NUZYRA, 27% of the dose was recovered as unchanged omadacycline in the urine. In healthy male volunteers receiving 300-mg oral [ 14 C] NUZYRA, 77.5% to 84.0% of the dose was recovered in the feces, approximately 14.4 % (range 10.8% to 17.4%) in the urine, with 95.5% of the administered radioactive dose recovered after 7 days. Lung Penetration The mean omadacycline concentrations over time for alveolar cells (AC), epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and plasma following IV administration of multiple doses of 100-mg of NUZYRA to healthy volunteers are shown in Figure 1. The steady-state omadacycline AUC 0-24h (302.5 hr*mcg/mL) in AC was 25.8-fold higher than the plasma AUC 0-24h , and the AUC 0-24h (17.2 hr*mcg/mL) in ELF was 1.5-fold higher than the AUC 0-24h in plasma. Figure 1: Mean (± SD) Concentrations of Omadacycline in Alveolar Cells, Epithelial Lining, and Plasma Following Multiple 100 mg IV Doses of NUZYRA to Healthy Subjects During Bronchoscopy Sampling Times Figure 1 Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of omadacycline were observed based on age, gender, race, weight, renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, and hepatic impairment. Patients with Renal Impairment A study was conducted to compare NUZYRA pharmacokinetics following 100-mg IV administration in 8 subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on stable hemodialysis, with and 8 -matched healthy control subjects. In the ESRD subjects, NUZYRA was administered on two separate occasions; immediately prior to dialysis and after dialysis, and the AUC, C max , and CL of NUZYRA were comparable between the renally impaired subjects and the matching healthy subjects. During dialysis, 7.9% of omadacycline was recovered in the dialysate. Renal impairment did not impact NUZYRA elimination. Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study was conducted to compare NUZYRA pharmacokinetics following intravenous and oral dosing to 5 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), and 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) as compared to 12 matched healthy control subjects. The AUC and C max of NUZYRA were comparable between the hepatically impaired subjects and the matching healthy subjects, and similar clearance was observed across all cohorts. Hepatic impairment did not impact NUZYRA elimination. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Administration of oral verapamil (P-gp inhibitor) two hours prior to a single 300 mg oral dose of NUZYRA increased omadacycline AUC by approximately 25% and C max by approximately 9%. In vitro Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that omadacycline does not inhibit nor induce metabolism mediated by CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5, or UGT1A1. Therefore, NUZYRA is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by the above stated human hepatic enzymes. Omadacycline is not an inhibitor of P-gp and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3. Omadacycline is a substrate of P- gp (see Clinical Studies above). Omadacycline is not a substrate or inhibitor of the major organic anion transporters (OAT-1 and 3), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), or multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2). Omadacycline was not an OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrate at supra-therapeutic concentrations (5-13 fold higher than clinically relevant concentrations). 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline antibacterial within the tetracycline class of antibacterial drugs. Omadacycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocks protein synthesis. In general, omadacycline is considered bacteriostatic; however, omadacycline has demonstrated bactericidal activity against some isolates of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae . Resistance The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Omadacycline was active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria expressing ribosomal protection proteins (TetM) and tetracycline resistance active efflux pumps (TetK and TetL), and in Enterobactericeae expressing the TetB efflux pump. Additionally, omadacycline was active against some S. aureus , S. pneumoniae , and H. influenzae strains carrying macrolide resistance genes ( ermA, B and/or C ), or ciprofloxacin resistance genes ( gyrA and parC ) and beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae . Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between omadacycline and other commonly used antibacterials (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, gentamicin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid). Antimicrobial Activity Omadacycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1.1 , 1.2) ] . Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates) Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Other microorganisms Chlamydophila pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila Mycoplasma pneumoniae Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates) Staphylococcus lugdunensis Streptococcus anginosus grp. (includes S. anginosus , S. intermedius , and S. constellatus ) Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacter cloacae Klebsiella pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of isolates of the following bacteria exhibit an in-vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for NUZYRA against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of NUZYRA in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well controlled clinical trials.

Mutagenesis Omadacycline was positive for clastogenicity and aneugenicity in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and for mutagenicity in an in vitro forward mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells. These effects were seen in the presence of metabolizing enzymes. Omadacycline was negative in a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster V79 cells and in vivo micronucleus assays administered intraperitoneally to ICR mice or intravenously to HanRcc: WIST rats. Impairment of Fertility Omadacycline administration to male rats in a fertility study caused reduced sperm counts and sperm motility at 20-mg/kg/day (approximately 1.3 times clinical systemic exposure, based on AUC in a separate study in rats at a similar dose), but had no effect on male fertility parameters. In general toxicity studies, inhibition of spermatogenesis occurred after administration of 45-mg/kg/day omadacycline (6 to 8 times the clinical AUC exposure) for 37 days or longer, but not at lower doses (15-mg/kg/day, ≤ 2 times clinical AUC exposure) or shorter treatment periods (4 weeks or less). In female rats, fertility was reduced at the 20-mg/kg/day dose (approximately equivalent to human exposures in a separate study in unmated females), characterized by reduced ovulation and increased embryonic loss when treatment occurred from before mating through early pregnancy. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Hyperpigmentation of the thyroid has been produced by members of the tetracycline class in the following species: in rats by omadacycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, tetracycline PO4, and methacycline; in minipigs by doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline PO4, and methacycline; in dogs by doxycycline and minocycline; in monkeys by omadacycline and minocycline. Minocycline, tetracycline PO4, methacycline, doxycycline, tetracycline base, oxytetracycline HCl, and tetracycline HCl were goitrogenic in rats fed a low iodine diet. This goitrogenic effect was accompanied by high radioactive iodine uptake. Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet. Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following: in rats and dogs (minocycline); in chickens (chlortetracycline); and in rats and mice (oxytetracycline).

NUZYRA was administered 100-mg intravenously every 12 hours for two doses on Day 1, followed by 100-mg intravenously daily, or 300-mg orally, daily. Moxifloxacin 400-mg was administered intravenously or orally daily. Total treatment duration was 7-14 days. All enrolled patients were expected to require a minimum of at least 3 days of intravenous treatment. Efficacy and safety of an oral loading dose was not evaluated in CABP. A total of 386 patients were randomized to NUZYRA and 388 patients were randomized to moxifloxacin. Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. Patients were predominantly male (55%) and white (92%). Approximately 60% of patients in each group belonged to PORT Risk Class III, 26% were PORT Risk Class IV and 14.5% were PORT Risk Class II. The median age was 62 years, mean BMI was 27.34 kg/m 2 , and approximately 47% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Among NUZYRA-treated patients, common comorbid conditions included hypertension (49.5%), diabetes mellitus (16.3%), chronic lung disease (21.2%), atrial fibrillation (10.1%), and coronary artery disease (9.1%). The majority of sites were in Eastern Europe, which accounted for 82% of enrollment; 3 patients were enrolled in the US. Clinical success at the early clinical response (ECR) timepoint, 72 to 120 hours after the first dose, was defined as survival with improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, sputum production, chest pain, dyspnea) without deterioration in any of these four symptoms in the intent to treat population (ITT), which consisted of all randomized patients.

Table 8: Investigator's Overall Assessment of Clinical Response at PTE Investigator's overall assessment of clinical response at PTE was defined as survival and improvement in signs and symptoms of CABP, based on the clinician's judgment, to the extent that further antibacterial therapy is not necessary in the ITT and CE populations. in Trial 1 (ITT and CE Population) Endpoint Population NUZYRA n/N (%) Moxifloxacin n/N (%) Treatment Difference (95% CI 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference. ) Clinical Success at PTE ITT 338/386 (87.6) 330/388 (85.1) 2.5 (-2.4, 7.4) Clinical Success at PTE CE 316/340 (92.9) 312/345 (90.4) 2.5 (-1.7, 6.8) Table 9: Investigator's Overall Assessment of Clinical Response at PTE by Baseline Pathogen in Trial 1 (micro-ITT population) Pathogen NUZYRA n/N (%) Moxifloxacin n/N (%) Streptococcus pneumoniae 37/43 (86.0) 31/34 (91.2) Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) 8/11 (72.7) 8/10 (80.0) Haemophilus influenzae 26/32 (81.3) 16/16 (100) Haemophilus parainfluenzae 15/18 (83.3) 13/17 (76.5) Klebsiella pneumoniae 10/13 (76.9) 11/13 (84.6) Legionella pneumophila 27/29 (93.1) 27/28 (96.4) Mycoplasma pneumoniae 31/35 (88.6) 25/29 (86.2) Chlamydophila pneumoniae 14/15 (93.3) 13/14 (92.9) 14.2 Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections A total of 1390 adults with ABSSSI were randomized in two multicenter, multinational, double-blind, double-dummy trials (Trial 2 NCT #02378480 and Trial 3 NCT #02877927). Both trials compared 7 to 14 days of NUZYRA to linezolid. Patients with cellulitis, major abscess, or wound infection were enrolled in the trials. In Trial 2, 329 patients were randomized to NUZYRA (100-mg intravenously every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 100-mg intravenously every 24 hours, with the option to switch to 300-mg orally every 24 hours) and 326 patients were randomized to linezolid (600-mg intravenously every 12 hours, with the option to switch to 600-mg orally every 12 hours). Patients in the trial had the following infections: cellulitis (38%), wound infection (33%) and major abscess (29%). The mean surface area of the infected lesion was 455 cm 2 in NUZYRA-treated patients and 498 cm 2 in linezolid-treated patients. The mean age of patients was 47 years. Subjects were predominantly male (65%) and white (92%), and mean BMI was 28.1 kg/m 2 . Among NUZYRA-treated patients, common comorbid conditions included drug abuse (53.9%), hepatitis C (29.1%), hypertension (20.4%), anxiety (19.5%), and depression (15.5%). Trial 2 was conducted globally including approximately 60% of patients enrolled in the United States. In Trial 3, 368 patients were randomized to NUZYRA (450-mg oral once a day on Days 1 and 2, followed by 300-mg orally once a day) and 367 were randomized to linezolid (600-mg orally every 12 hours). All patients were enrolled in the United States. Patients in the trial had the following infections: wound infections (58%), cellulitis (24%), and major abscess (18%). The mean surface area of the infected lesion was 424 cm 2 in NUZYRA-treated patients and 399 cm 2 in linezolid-treated patients. The mean age of patients was 44 years. Subjects were predominantly male (63%) and white (91%) and mean BMI was 27.9 kg/m 2 . The most common comorbid conditions included drug abuse (72.8%), tobacco use (12.0%), and chronic hepatitis C infection (31.5%). In Trials 2 and 3, approximately 12% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. In both trials, efficacy was determined by the successful early clinical response at 48 to 72 hours after the first dose in the mITT population and was defined as a 20% or greater decrease in lesion size. Table 10 summarizes the clinical response rates in the two trials. The mITT population was defined as all randomized subjects without a sole Gram-negative causative pathogen at screening. Table 10: Clinical Success Clinical success at early clinical response (ECR) at 48 to 72 hours after the first dose, was defined as a 20% or greater decrease in lesion size without any reasons for failure (less than 20% reduction in lesion size, administration of rescue antibacterial therapy, use of another antibacterial or surgical procedure to treat for lack of efficacy, or death). at the ECR Timepoint in the mITT Population in Trial 2 and Trial 3 Study NUZYRA (%) Linezolid (%) Treatment Difference (Two-Sided 95% CI) 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference. Trial 2 84.8 85.5 -0.7 (-6.3, 4.9) Trial 3 87.3 82.2 +5.1 (-0.2, 10.5) Clinical response at the post therapy evaluation (PTE, 7 to 14 days after last dose) visit in the mITT and clinically evaluable (CE) populations was defined as survival after completion of study treatment without receiving any alternative antibacterial therapy other than NUZYRA, without unplanned major surgical intervention, and sufficient resolution of infection such that further antibacterial therapy is not needed (see Table 11 ). Clinical response rates at PTE by most common pathogen in the microbiological-mITT population, defined as all patients in the mITT population, who had at least 1 Gram- positive causative pathogen identified at baseline are provided in Table 12. The CE population consisted of all mITT patients who had a diagnosis of ABSSSI, received a minimum number of expected doses of study drug, did not have any protocol deviations that would affect the assessment of efficacy, and had investigator assessment at the PTE Visit.

Advise patients that a greater proportion of patients who received the oral loading dose of NUZYRA for treatment of ABSSSI experienced nausea and vomiting. Allergic Reactions Advise patients that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur and that serious allergic reactions require immediate treatment. Ask the patient about any previous hypersensitivity reactions to NUZYRA, or other tetracycline class antibacterials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Administration with Food Instruct patients to fast 4 hours before and 2 hours after taking NUZYRA tablets and not to consume dairy products, antacids, or multivitamins for 4 hours after taking NUZYRA tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Tooth Discoloration and Inhibition of Bone Growth Advise patients that NUZYRA, like other tetracycline-class drugs, may cause permanent tooth discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. Lactation Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with NUZYRA and for 4 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] Diarrhea Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including NUZYRA, which usually ends when the antibacterial drugs is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery or bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever). If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Tetracycline Class Adverse Reactions Inform patients that NUZYRA is similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Antibacterial Resistance Advise patients that antibacterial drugs including NUZYRA should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections ( e.g. , the common cold). When NUZYRA is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by NUZYRA or other antibacterial drugs in the future.']","['PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 10 Vial Carton NDC 71715-001-02 Contains 10 of NDC 71715-001-01 RX ONLY NUZYRA ® (omadacycline) for injection 100 mg per single-dose vial.

( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on preparation and administration. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Administer ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes at Week 0, Week 2, and every 4 weeks thereafter. If a dose is missed, administer ADAKVEO as soon as possible. If ADAKVEO is administered within 2 weeks after the missed dose, continue dosing according to the patient's original schedule. If ADAKVEO is administered more than 2 weeks after the missed dose, continue dosing every 4 weeks thereafter. Physicians should reevaluate the treatment at least yearly, to assess individual patient’s response to treatment and consider discontinuing therapy with ADAKVEO if no perceived benefit is achieved. ADAKVEO may be given with or without hydroxyurea. 2.2 Preparation and Administration ADAKVEO should be prepared and administered by a healthcare professional. Preparation Use aseptic technique to prepare the solution for infusion. Calculate the dose (mg) and the total volume (mL) of ADAKVEO solution required, and the number of ADAKVEO vials needed based on the patient’s actual body weight. Prepare 5 mg of ADAKVEO per kg of actual body weight. Calculate the volume of ADAKVEO to be used according to the following equation: Dilution Dilute ADAKVEO in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a total volume of 100 mL for intravenous infusion as follows: Obtain the number of vials required. One vial is needed for every 10 mL of ADAKVEO. Bring vials to room temperature for a maximum of 4 hours prior to the start of preparation (piercing the first vial). Visually inspect the vials. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. ADAKVEO is clear to opalescent, colorless or may have a slightly brownish-yellow tint. Do not use if particles are present in the solution. Obtain a 100 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection infusion bag/container. Infusion bags/containers must be made of either polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), or polypropylene (PP). Remove a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection from the infusion bag/container that is equal to the required volume of ADAKVEO solution. Withdraw the necessary amount of ADAKVEO solution and dilute by adding to the infusion bag/container containing 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection. The volume of ADAKVEO added to the infusion bag/container should not exceed 96 mL. Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the diluted solution. DO NOT SHAKE. Single-dose vials. Discard unused portion. Storage Conditions of the Diluted Solution Administer ADAKVEO diluted solution as soon as possible. If not administered immediately, store the prepared solution either: At room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for no more than 4.5 hours from the start of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. Under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 24 hours, from the start of the time of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. This includes the storage of the diluted solution and the time to warm up to room temperature. Protect the diluted solution from light during storage under refrigeration. Administration Administer ADAKVEO diluted solution by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes through an intravenous line, which must contain a sterile, nonpyrogenic 0.2-micron inline filter. No incompatibilities have been observed between ADAKVEO and infusion sets composed of PVC, polyethylene (PE-lined PVC), polyurethane (PU), and in-line filter membranes composed of polyethersulfone (PES, neutral and positively charged), positively charged polyamide (PA), and polysulphone (PSU). Do not mix or coadminister with other drugs through the same intravenous line. After administration of ADAKVEO, flush the line with at least 25 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection. Dispose of any unused product or waste material in accordance with local requirements.

Temporarily interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild or moderate infusion-related reactions and initiate symptomatic treatment. Exercise caution with corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease unless clinically indicated (e.g., treatment of anaphylaxis). ( 5.1 ) Interference With Automated Platelet Counts (platelet clumping): Run test as soon as possible or use citrate tubes. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions In the SUSTAIN clinical trial, infusion-related reactions (IRRs) (defined as occurring during/within 24 hours of infusion) were observed in 2 (3%) patients treated with ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg. In the STAND clinical trial, IRRs were observed in 6 (7%) patients treated with ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg. IRRs presented most frequently as pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, pruritis, diarrhea, and pyrexia. Some IRRs have required hospitalizations. The majority of these IRRs occurred during the first and second infusions. Monitor for and advise patients to report signs and symptoms of IRRs. Discontinue ADAKVEO infusion for severe IRRs and institute appropriate medical care. Consider permanent discontinuation of ADAKVEO treatment in case of severe IRRs. Manage mild to moderate infusion-related reactions with temporary interruption of infusion, slowing the rate of infusion, symptomatic treatment (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opioids, antihistamines, intravenous fluids, and/or oxygen therapy). For subsequent infusions, consider premedication and/or infusion rate reduction. Exercise caution with corticosteroids in patients with sickle cell disease unless clinically indicated (e.g., treatment of anaphylaxis). Use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of complications such as acute chest syndrome and fat embolism. Infusion-Related Reactions and Vaso-occlusive Crises Infusion-related reactions are sometimes indistinguishable from vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events. IRRs and VOCs may occur concomitantly and/or VOCs may occur as a consequence of an IRR. 5.2 Laboratory Test Interference Interference with automated platelet counts (platelet clumping) has been observed following administration of ADAKVEO, in particular, when blood samples were collected in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Mitigation strategies are recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were headache, arthralgia, nausea, back pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, pyrexia, diarrhea, vomiting, and oropharyngeal pain.

Sickle Cell Disease SUSTAIN Trial The safety of ADAKVEO was evaluated in the SUSTAIN trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Eligible patients were diagnosed with sickle cell disease (any genotype, including HbSS, HbSC, HbS beta 0 -thalassemia, HbS beta + -thalassemia, and others). Patients received ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg (N = 66) or 2.5 mg/kg (N = 64) or placebo (N = 62) administered by intravenous infusion on Week 0, Week 2, and every 4 weeks thereafter. The safety evaluation below is limited to the patients who received the recommended dose of 5 mg/kg. Among the 66 patients that received the recommended dose (5 mg/kg), 83% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 61% were exposed for approximately one year; forty-two (64%) patients were treated with ADAKVEO in combination with hydroxyurea. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2 patients (3%) treated with ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg; both reactions were pyrexia. Two deaths (3%) occurred in the ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg treatment group. None of the deaths were considered to be related to ADAKVEO. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were arthralgia, nausea, back pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, and diarrhea. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions in the SUSTAIN trial.

( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal studies, ADAKVEO has the potential to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, intravenous administration of crizanlizumab-tmca to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in a non-dose related increased fetal loss (abortions/stillbirths) at doses approximately 2.8 times the exposure at the recommended clinical dose at 5 mg/kg/dose once every 4 weeks (see Data) . There are insufficient human data on ADAKVEO use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. ADAKVEO should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is approximately 14% and up to 43%, respectively. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Women with sickle cell disease have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the mother and the fetus. Pregnant women are at greater risk for VOCs, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and maternal mortality. For the fetus, there is an increased risk for intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and perinatal mortality. Data Animal Data In an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study in cynomolgus monkeys, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of crizanlizumab-tmca at 10 and 50 mg/kg once every 2 weeks during the period of onset of organogenesis through delivery. No maternal toxicity was observed. Maternal exposures at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg were between 2.8 and 16 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) in patients with sickle cell disease at 5 mg/kg/dose once every 4 weeks. There was an increase in fetal loss (abortions or still births) at both crizanlizumab-tmca doses which was higher in the third trimester. There were no effects on infant growth and development through 6-months postpartum that were attributable to crizanlizumab-tmca. Measurable crizanlizumab-tmca serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at postnatal Day 28, confirming that crizanlizumab crosses the placental barrier. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data on the presence of crizanlizumab-tmca in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed child to crizanlizumab-tmca are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ADAKVEO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ADAKVEO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ADAKVEO for sickle cell disease have been established in pediatric patients aged 16 years and older. Use of ADAKVEO for sickle cell disease is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and pediatric patients (SUSTAIN trial). The SUSTAIN trial enrolled one pediatric patient treated with ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg aged 16 years old [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)] . The safety and efficacy of ADAKVEO in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use There were no ADAKVEO-treated patients 65 years of age and older in the clinical studies for sickle cell disease [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Clinical studies of ADAKVEO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.']","['8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from animal studies, ADAKVEO has the potential to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

Crizanlizumab-tmca is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It is composed of 2 heavy chains, each containing 448 amino acids, and 2 light chains each containing 218 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular weight of approximately 146 kDa. ADAKVEO (crizanlizumab-tmca) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent, colorless to slightly brownish-yellow solution for dilution and subsequent administration by intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL vial contains 100 mg crizanlizumab-tmca, citric acid (5.4 mg), polysorbate 80 (2 mg), sodium citrate (50.5 mg), sucrose (753.3 mg), and water for injection with a pH of 6.']","['12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Crizanlizumab-tmca is a humanized IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to P-selectin and blocks interactions with its ligands, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). Crizanlizumab can also dissociate preformed P-selectin/PSGL-1 complex. Binding P-selectin on the surface of the activated endothelium and platelets blocks interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, red blood cells, and leukocytes. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics ADAKVEO resulted in a dose-dependent P-selectin inhibition (measured ex vivo ) in patients with sickle cell disease and healthy volunteers. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab-tmca were evaluated in healthy volunteers and patients with sickle cell disease. The mean crizanlizumab-tmca C max , AUC last , or AUC inf increased disproportionally over the dose range of 0.2 to 8 mg/kg (0.04 to 1.6 times the approved recommended dosage) in healthy volunteers. In healthy volunteers administered the 5 mg/kg dose, the mean [coefficient of variation (CV%)] crizanlizumab-tmca C max , AUC last , or AUC inf were 0.16 (15.3%) mg/mL, 33.6 (12.6%) mg*hr/mL and 34.6 (13.1%) mg*hr/mL, respectively. Distribution The mean (% CV) volume of distribution was 4.26 (25.1%) L after a single crizanlizumab-tmca 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers. Elimination The mean (% CV) terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of crizanlizumab-tmca was 10.6 (20.5%) days and the mean clearance was 11.7 (16.2%) mL/hr at 5 mg/kg doses in healthy volunteers. The mean (% CV) elimination t 1/2 of crizanlizumab-tmca was 11.4 (31.5%) days during dosing interval in patients with sickle cell disease. Metabolism Crizanlizumab-tmca is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. Specific Populations The effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab-tmca is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Hydroxyurea had no clinically meaningful effect on crizanlizumab-tmca pharmacokinetics in patients in clinical studies. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of ADAKVEO or of other crizanlizumab products. The immunogenicity of ADAKVEO was evaluated using a validated bridging immunoassay for the detection of binding anti-crizanlizumab-tmca antibodies. In a single arm, open label multiple dose study, 0 of the 45 patients with sickle cell disease treated with ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg tested positive for treatment-induced anti-crizanlizumab-tmca antibodies. In a single-dose study in healthy subjects, 1 of the 61 (1.6%) evaluable subjects tested positive for a treatment-induced anti-crizanlizumab-tmca antibodies. No treatment induced anti-crizanlizumab-tmca antibodies were detected (0 of 84 patients) in a Phase 3 study at 5 mg/kg over the 52 week time period (samples collected at baseline, Weeks 3, 15, 19, 27, and 51). Therefore, no significant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics has been observed or is expected.']","['12.1 Mechanism of Action Crizanlizumab-tmca is a humanized IgG2 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to P-selectin and blocks interactions with its ligands, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). Crizanlizumab can also dissociate preformed P-selectin/PSGL-1 complex. Binding P-selectin on the surface of the activated endothelium and platelets blocks interactions between endothelial cells, platelets, red blood cells, and leukocytes.']",['12.2 Pharmacodynamics ADAKVEO resulted in a dose-dependent P-selectin inhibition (measured ex vivo ) in patients with sickle cell disease and healthy volunteers.'],"['12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab-tmca were evaluated in healthy volunteers and patients with sickle cell disease. The mean crizanlizumab-tmca C max , AUC last , or AUC inf increased disproportionally over the dose range of 0.2 to 8 mg/kg (0.04 to 1.6 times the approved recommended dosage) in healthy volunteers. In healthy volunteers administered the 5 mg/kg dose, the mean [coefficient of variation (CV%)] crizanlizumab-tmca C max , AUC last , or AUC inf were 0.16 (15.3%) mg/mL, 33.6 (12.6%) mg*hr/mL and 34.6 (13.1%) mg*hr/mL, respectively. Distribution The mean (% CV) volume of distribution was 4.26 (25.1%) L after a single crizanlizumab-tmca 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers. Elimination The mean (% CV) terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of crizanlizumab-tmca was 10.6 (20.5%) days and the mean clearance was 11.7 (16.2%) mL/hr at 5 mg/kg doses in healthy volunteers. The mean (% CV) elimination t 1/2 of crizanlizumab-tmca was 11.4 (31.5%) days during dosing interval in patients with sickle cell disease. Metabolism Crizanlizumab-tmca is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. Specific Populations The effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of crizanlizumab-tmca is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Hydroxyurea had no clinically meaningful effect on crizanlizumab-tmca pharmacokinetics in patients in clinical studies.']","['13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with crizanlizumab-tmca.

A total of 198 patients with sickle cell disease, any genotype (HbSS, HbSC, HbS/beta 0 -thalassemia, HbS/beta + -thalassemia, and others), and a history of 2-10 VOCs in the previous 12 months were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg (N = 67), ADAKVEO 2.5 mg/kg (N = 66), or placebo (N = 65) administered over a period of 30 minutes by intravenous infusion on Week 0, Week 2, and every 4 weeks thereafter for a treatment duration of 52 weeks. Randomization was stratified by patients already receiving hydroxyurea (Y/N) and by the number of VOCs in the previous 12 months (2 to 4, 5 to 10). Patients received ADAKVEO (with or without hydroxyurea) and were allowed to receive occasional transfusions and pain medications [i.e., acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids] on an as needed basis. Patients recruited in the study had complications associated with sickle cell disease and other comorbidities, including a history of acute chest syndrome (18%); pulmonary hypertension (8%); priapism (7%); psychiatric manifestations (25%), including depression and anxiety; hypertension (17%); cholelithiasis (17%). Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups (see Table 3).

A VOC leading to a healthcare visit was defined as an acute episode of pain with no cause other than a vasoocclusive event that required a medical facility visit and treatment with oral or parenteral opioids, or parenteral NSAIDs. Acute chest syndrome, hepatic sequestration, splenic sequestration, and priapism (requiring a visit to a medical facility) were also considered VOCs. Patients with sickle cell disease who received ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg had a lower median annual rate of VOC compared to patients who received placebo (1.63 vs. 2.98) which was statistically significant (p = 0.010). Reductions in the frequency of VOCs were observed among patients regardless of sickle cell disease genotype and/or hydroxyurea use. Thirty-six percent (36%) of patients treated with ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg did not experience a VOC compared to 17% of placebo-treated patients. The median time to first VOC from randomization was 4.1 months in the ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg arm compared to 1.4 months in the placebo.

The efficacy results of STAND study are summarized in Table 6 below. In this study, VOC was defined as a pain crisis (acute onset of pain for which there is no other medically determined explanation other than vaso-occlusion) which requires therapy with oral or parenteral opioids or parenteral NSAID. Acute chest syndrome (ACS), priapism and hepatic or splenic sequestration were considered VOCs in this study. A total of 252 sickle cell disease patients were randomized to the study, 85 in placebo arm, 84 in ADAKVEO 5 mg/kg arm and 83 in ADAKVEO 7.5 mg/kg arm. The 7.5 mg/kg ADAKVEO dose is not approved and is not recommended for use. Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups (see Table 5).

( 5.2 ) Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal in Patients Who are Dependent on Opioids : LYBALVI can precipitate opioid withdrawal in patients who are dependent on opioids. Prior to initiating LYBALVI, there should be at least a 7-day opioid-free interval from the last use of short-acting opioids, and at least a 14-day opioid-free interval from the last use of long-acting opioids to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Vulnerability to Life-Threatening Opioid Overdose : Risk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome LYBALVI Opioid Blockade: Attempts to overcome LYBALVI opioid blockade with high or repeated doses of opioids may lead to fatal opioid intoxication, particularly if LYBALVI therapy is interrupted or discontinued. ( 5.4 ) Risk of Resuming Opioids in Patients with Prior Opioid Use : Patients with a history of chronic opioid use prior to LYBALVI treatment may have decreased opioid tolerance if LYBALVI therapy is interrupted or discontinued. ( 5.4 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome : Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. ( 5.5 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : Discontinue if DRESS is suspected. ( 5.6 ) Metabolic Changes : Monitor for hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. ( 5.7 ) Tardive Dyskinesia : Discontinue if clinically appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope : Monitor heart rate and blood pressure and warn patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and risk of dehydration or syncope. ( 5.9 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis : Perform complete blood counts in patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell (WBC) count. Consider discontinuation if clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. ( 5.11 ) Seizures : Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.13 ) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment : Use caution when operating machinery. ( 5.14 ) Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Effects: Use with caution with other anticholinergic drugs and in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, paralytic ileus or related conditions. ( 5.16 ) Hyperprolactinemia : May elevate prolactin levels. ( 5.17 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients was significantly greater than in placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively). Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times that seen in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. LYBALVI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. LYBALVI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 5.3 Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal in Patients Who Are Physiologically Dependent on Opioids Samidorphan, an opioid antagonist that is a component of LYBALVI, can precipitate opioid withdrawal in patients who are dependent on opioids, which can lead to an opioid withdrawal syndrome, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Therefore, LYBALVI is contraindicated in patients who are using opioids or undergoing acute opioid withdrawal. Prior to initiating LYBALVI, there should be at least a 7-day opioid-free interval from last use of short-acting opioids, and at least a 14-day opioid-free interval from the last use of long-acting opioids. Explain the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and the importance of giving an accurate account of last opioid use to patients and caregivers [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . 5.4 Vulnerability to Life-Threatening Opioid Overdose Risk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome Samidorphan Blockade LYBALVI contains samidorphan, an opioid antagonist. Attempting to overcome LYBALVI's opioid blockade with high or repeated doses of exogenous opioids (e.g., because of ineffective analgesia or opioid withdrawal symptoms) could lead to life-threatening or fatal opioid intoxication (e.g., respiratory arrest, circulatory collapse), particularly if LYBALVI therapy is interrupted or discontinued, subjecting the patient to high levels of unopposed opioid agonist as the samidorphan blockade wanes. Inform patients of the potential consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade and the serious risks of taking opioids concurrently with LYBALVI or while transitioning off LYBALVI. In emergency situations, if a LYBALVI-treated patient requires opioid treatment as part of anesthesia or analgesia: Discontinue LYBALVI, Opioids should be administered by individual(s) trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of opioids, specifically the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation, and Appropriately trained personnel should continuously monitor the patient in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. For recommendations on starting opioids in LYBALVI-treated patients in non-emergent situations, see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ). Risk of Resuming Opioids in Patients with Prior Opioid Use Patients with a history of chronic opioid use prior to treatment with LYBALVI may have decreased opioid tolerance if LYBALVI therapy is interrupted or discontinued. Advise patients that this decreased tolerance may increase the risk of opioid overdose if opioids are resumed at the previously tolerated dosage. 5.5 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue LYBALVI and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5.6 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with exposure to olanzapine, a component of LYBALVI [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue LYBALVI if DRESS is suspected. 5.7 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including LYBALVI, have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Any patient treated with LYBALVI should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with LYBALVI should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Patients starting treatment with LYBALVI should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Antipsychotics have caused adverse alterations in lipids. Patients starting treatment with LYBALVI should undergo fasting lipid profile testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Weight gain has been observed with use of antipsychotics. Monitor weight prior to initiating LYBALVI and frequently thereafter. 5.8 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increases with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, LYBALVI should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on LYBALVI, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with LYBALVI despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In the 4-week, placebo-controlled study, from analysis of the vital signs data, rates of orthostatic hypotension were less than 2% in LYBALVI- and placebo-, and olanzapine-treated patients. In the 24-week, olanzapine-controlled study, from analysis of the vital signs data, rates of orthostatic hypotension in LYBALVI-treated patients were 3.7%, compared to 0.4% in olanzapine-treated patients. Monitor orthostatic vital signs in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (e.g., elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications or CNS depressants [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] , patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. LYBALVI has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiovascular disease. Such patients were excluded from the premarketing clinical trials. 5.10 Falls Antipsychotics, including LYBALVI, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.11 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents, including LYBALVI [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in this class. Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of LYBALVI at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue LYBALVI in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) and follow their WBC until recovery. 5.12 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Antipsychotic drugs, including LYBALVI, should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration. 5.13 Seizures Like other antipsychotic drugs, LYBALVI may cause seizures. This risk is greatest in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in older patients. 5.14 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment LYBALVI, like other antipsychotics, may cause somnolence and has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. In a LYBALVI placebo-controlled study, somnolence occurred in 9% of LYBALVI-treated patients compared to 2.2% in patients treated with placebo. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that LYBALVI therapy does not affect them adversely. 5.15 Body Temperature Dysregulation Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body's ability to reduce core body temperature. Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use LYBALVI with caution in patients who may experience these conditions. 5.16 Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Effects Olanzapine, a component of LYBALVI, exhibits in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . In premarketing clinical trials with oral olanzapine, olanzapine was associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for discontinuations, but LYBALVI should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions. In postmarketing experience, the risk for severe adverse reactions (including fatalities) was increased with concomitant use of anticholinergic medications [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.17 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, olanzapine, a component of LYBALVI, elevates prolactin levels, and the elevation can persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously-detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive. In the 4-week placebo-controlled trial, shifts from normal to high prolactin values (>30 ng/mL for females; >20 ng/mL for males) occurred in 41.4% of females and 32.9% of males treated with LYBALVI, in 56.1% of females and 37.1% of males treated with olanzapine, and in 10% of females and 4.8% of males treated with placebo [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . In the 24-week, olanzapine-controlled study, shifts from normal to high prolactin values occurred in 32.9% of females and 22.5% of males treated with LYBALVI, and in 41.7% of females and 28.5% of males treated with olanzapine. 5.18 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with Lithium or Valproate If LYBALVI is administered with lithium or valproate, refer to the lithium or valproate Prescribing Information for a description of the risks for these products including, but not limited to, the warnings and precautions for lithium or valproate [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.19 Interference with Laboratory Tests for Opioid Detection LYBALVI may cause false positive results with urinary immunoassay methods used for detecting opioids. Use an alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) to confirm positive opioid urine drug screen results [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] .""]","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-related Psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal in Patients Who Are Dependent on Opioids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Vulnerability to Life-Threatening Opioid Overdose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Metabolic Changes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Tardive Dyskinesia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Falls [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] Dysphagia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] Body Temperature Regulation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )] Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] Hyperprolactinemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )] Risks Associated with Combination Treatment with Lithium or Valproate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and at least twice placebo): Schizophrenia (LYBALVI): weight increased, somnolence, dry mouth, and headache.

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Schizophrenia Patient Exposure The safety of LYBALVI was evaluated in 1262 patients (18 to 67 years of age) diagnosed with schizophrenia in four double-blind, controlled studies and three long-term safety extension studies of up to 3 years of duration. This experience corresponds to approximately 910 person-years. In these studies, there were a total of 663 patients exposed to LYBALVI for at least 6 months, and 386 patients for at least one year. Adverse Reactions in the Short-Term (4 week) Placebo-Controlled Trial in Adults with Schizophrenia The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5% of patients exposed to LYBALVI and greater than twice the rate of placebo) are weight increased, somnolence, dry mouth, and headache. Adverse reactions associated with the use of LYBALVI (incidence of 2% or greater and greater than in placebo-treated patients) are shown in Table 2 .

Adverse Reactions in the Long-Term (24-week), Active-Controlled Trial in Adults with Schizophrenia In the 24-week, olanzapine-controlled trial in patients with stable schizophrenia, adverse reactions associated with the use of LYBALVI (incidence of 2% or greater) include: weight increased (25%), somnolence (21%), dry mouth (13%), increased appetite (11%), waist circumference increased (6%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (5%), headache (4%), lethargy (4%), sedation (4%), akathisia (3%), alanine aminotransferase increased (3%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (3%), constipation (3%), dizziness (3%), fatigue (3%), nausea (3%), blood pressure increased (3%), neutrophil count decreased (3%), blood insulin increased (2%), weight decreased (2%), and dyslipidemia (2%). Adverse reactions that led to LYBALVI treatment discontinuation in more than one patient include somnolence (2%), weight increased (2%), neutropenia (2%), glycosylated hemoglobin increased (1%), schizophrenia (1%), and liver function test abnormal (1%). Hyperglycemia Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL. Hyperglycemia, as defined by fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, has been observed in patients treated with LYBALVI. In the 4-week placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with schizophrenia, shifts in fasting glucose from normal to high occurred in 4% of patients treated with LYBALVI, 1% of patients treated with olanzapine, and no patients treated with placebo. In the 24-week olanzapine-controlled trial, patients treated with LYBALVI were more likely to experience abnormal shifts in glycemic parameters than patients treated with olanzapine ( Table 3 ) Table 3: Changes in Glycemic Parameters in a 24-Week Trial of Patients with Schizophrenia * n: number of patients with reported abnormal shifts; N: number of patients who had assessments at both baseline and endpoint for mean change, or normal at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment for shift. LYBALVI Olanzapine Proportion of Patients with Shifts, % (n/N)* Glucose Normal to High (<100 mg/dL to ≥126 mg/dL) 12 (26/223) 8 (18/219) Impaired (≥100 mg/dL and <126 mg/dL) to High (≥126 mg/dL) 24 (9/38) 11 (5/47) Increase ≥10 mg/dL 66 (174/265) 57 (154/270) Hemoglobin A1c Normal (<5.7%) to Impaired (≥5.7% and <6.5%) 42 (86/204) 35 (68/197) Normal to High (<5.7% to ≥6.5%) 0.5 (1/204) 1.5 (3/197) Impaired (≥5.7% and <6.5%) to High (≥6.5%) 9.5 (6/63) 9.2 (7/76) Dyslipidemia In the 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with schizophrenia, shifts in fasting triglycerides from normal to high occurred in 14% of patients treated with LYBALVI and 4% of patients treated with placebo. In the 24-week olanzapine-controlled study, mean changes in fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were similar in patients treated with LYBALVI and in patients treated with olanzapine. Weight Gain In the 4-week placebo-controlled study in adult patients with schizophrenia, mean changes in weight, and proportion of patients with ≥7% weight increase, were greater in patients treated with LYBALVI and olanzapine than in patients on placebo. In that study, mean weight gain was 3.0 kg in patients treated with LYBALVI, 2.4 kg in patients treated with olanzapine, and 0.2 kg in patients treated with placebo. The proportion of patients with ≥7% weight increase was 26% in patients treated with LYBALVI, 20% in patients treated with olanzapine, and 5% in patients treated with placebo. In the 24-week trial, LYBALVI-treated patients gained on average 4.2% of baseline body weight. The proportion of patients treated with LYBALVI with ≥10% body weight gain was 17.8% [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Extrapyramidal Symptoms In the 4-week placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with schizophrenia, patients were assessed using the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (total score ranges from 1 to 14), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia (total score ranges from 0 to 14), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesias (total score ranges from 0 to 28). The mean changes from baseline to last study visit for the SAS, BARS, and AIMS was similar in LYBALVI-treated patients and in placebo-treated patients. The mean changes for LYBALVI- vs placebo-treated patients were 0.00 vs -0.2 for AIMS, 0.0 vs -0.1 for BARS, and 0.0 vs -0.3 for SAS, respectively. The rate of parkinsonism (SAS total score >3) was lower in patients treated with LYBALVI (4%) compared to those on placebo (10%). The rates of akathisia (BARS global clinical assessment score ≥2) and dyskinesia (AIMS score ≥3 on any of the first 7 items, or a score ≥2 on two or more of any of the first 7 items) were similar in patients treated with LYBALVI and in those on placebo. Rates of akathisia were 6.0% and 8.2% in patients treated with LYBALVI and placebo, respectively, and the rate of dyskinesia was 1.5% both in LYBALVI-treated and in placebo-treated patients. The frequency of reported adverse reactions related to extrapyramidal symptoms, including akathisia, restlessness, muscle spasms, bradykinesia, tremor, extrapyramidal disorder, and parkinsonism was 2% both in LYBALVI-treated and in placebo-treated patients. In the 24-week active-controlled trial, the mean change from baseline to the last visit for the SAS, BARS, and AIMS was similar in LYBALVI-treated patients and in those treated with the active control. Extrapyramidal adverse reactions, including parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesia, had a similar incidence in LYBALVI-treated patients and in those treated with the active control: any extrapyramidal symptom was 8%, akathisia was 3%. Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia, (prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups) may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. Although these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Bipolar Disorder The safety of LYBALVI for the treatment of bipolar I disorder (mixed or manic) monotherapy and adjunct to lithium or valproate relies on information from adequate and well-controlled studies of olanzapine tablets in bipolar I disorder. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5% of patients exposed to olanzapine and greater than or equal to twice the rate of placebo) from short-term trials of olanzapine (manic or mixed episodes) are somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia, constipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5% of patients exposed to olanzapine and greater than or equal to twice the rate of placebo) from short-term trials of olanzapine as adjunct to lithium or valproate (manic or mixed episodes) are dry mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, dizziness, back pain, constipation, speech disorder, increased salivation, amnesia, paresthesia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of olanzapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria) cholestatic or mixed liver injury, hepatitis, jaundice diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting) Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) hyperlipidemia (random cholesterol levels of ≥240 mg/dL and random triglyceride levels of ≥1000 mg/dL have been reported) neutropenia pancreatitis priapism rash restless legs syndrome rhabdomyolysis salivary hypersecretion stuttering Stuttering was only studied in oral and long acting injection (LAI) formulations. venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis)']","['<table ID=""t2"" width=""100%""><caption>Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in &#x2265;2% of LYBALVI-Treated Patients and Greater than Placebo in a 4-Week Schizophrenia Trial </caption><col width=""33.333%"" align=""left""/><col width=""33.333%"" align=""left""/><col width=""33.333%"" align=""left""/><thead><tr><th align=""left"" valign=""bottom"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Lrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Adverse Reaction</content></th><th align=""center"" valign=""bottom"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">Placebo (N=134)</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">%</content></th><th align=""center"" valign=""bottom"" styleCode=""Toprule Botrule Rrule""><content styleCode=""bold"">LYBALVI (10 mg/10 mg, 20 mg/10 mg) (N=134)</content> <content styleCode=""bold"">%</content></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Weight increased </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">3 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">19 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Somnolence </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">9 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Dry mouth </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">1 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">7 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Headache </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">3 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">6 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Blood insulin increased </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">1 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">3 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Sedation </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">0 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Dizziness </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">1 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2 </td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Lrule Rrule"">Neutrophil count decreased </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">0 </td><td align=""center"" valign=""top"" styleCode=""Botrule Rrule"">2 </td></tr></tbody></table>', '<table ID=""t3"" width=""100%""><caption>Table 3: Changes in Glycemic Parameters in a 24-Week Trial of Patients with Schizophrenia </caption><col width=""62.521%"" align=""left""/><col width=""18.740%"" align=""left""/><col width=""18.740%"" align=""left""/><tfoot><tr><td colspan=""3"" align=""left"" valign=""top""><paragraph styleCode=""footnote"">* n: number of patients with reported abnormal shifts;

( 7.1 ) CNS Acting Drugs : May potentiate orthostatic hypotension. ( 7.1 ) Anticholinergic Drugs: Can increase risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) Antihypertensive Agents : Monitor blood pressure. ( 7.2 ) Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists : Not recommended. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on LYBALVI Table 4 describes clinically significant drug interactions where the concomitant use of other drugs affects LYBALVI. Table 4: Effects of Other Drugs on LYBALVI Strong CYP3A4 Inducer Clinical Implication: Coadministration of LYBALVI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases AUC inf of olanzapine and samidorphan [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may reduce LYBALVI efficacy. Prevention or Management: Concomitant use of LYBALVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitor Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of LYBALVI with a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor increases olanzapine AUC and C max [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of LYBALVI adverse reactions. Prevention or Management: Consider reducing the dosage of the olanzapine component in LYBALVI when used concomitantly with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors. CYP1A2 Inducer Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of LYBALVI with CYP1A2 inducers decreases olanzapine exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce LYBALVI efficacy. Prevention or Management: Consider increasing the dosage of the olanzapine component in LYBALVI when used concomitantly with CYP1A2 inducers. Diazepam, Alcohol, and Other CNS Acting Drugs Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of diazepam, alcohol, or other CNS acting drugs with LYBALVI may potentiate the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Prevention or Management: LYBALVI should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitantly diazepam or other CNS acting drugs, or using alcohol. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Implication: Concomitant treatment with olanzapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Prevention or Management: LYBALVI should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] . 7.2 Effects of LYBALVI on Other Drugs Table 5 describes clinically significant drug interactions where concomitant use of LYBALVI affects other drugs. Table 5: Effects of LYBALVI on Other Drugs Antihypertensive Agents Clinical Implication: LYBALVI may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Prevention or Management: Monitor blood pressure and reduce dosage of antihypertensive drug in accordance with its approved product labeling. Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists Clinical Implication: LYBALVI may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Prevention or Management: Concomitant use of LYBALVI is not recommended with levodopa and dopamine agonists. 7.3 Opioids LYBALVI is contraindicated in patients who are using opioids or undergoing acute opioid withdrawal [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. LYBALVI increases the risk of precipitating acute opioid withdrawal in patients who are dependent on opioids. Prior to initiating LYBALVI, there should be at least a 7-day opioid-free interval from the last use of short-acting opioids, and at least a 14-day opioid-free interval from the last use of long-acting opioids [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . In emergency situations, if a LYBALVI-treated patient requires opioid treatment for anesthesia or analgesia, discontinue LYBALVI. The opioid should be administered by properly trained individual(s), and the patient should be properly monitored in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. In non-emergency situations, if a LYBALVI-treated patient is expected to require opioid treatment (e.g., for analgesia during or after an elective surgical procedure) discontinue LYBALVI at least 5 days before opioid treatment and start olanzapine or another antipsychotic, if needed. Given that LYBALVI contains samidorphan, an opioid antagonist, opioid treatment may be less effective or ineffective shortly after LYBALVI discontinuation because of the presence of samidorphan. 7.4 Interference with Laboratory Tests Interference with Laboratory Tests for Opioid Detection Because LYBALVI contains samidorphan, an opioid antagonist, LYBALVI may be cross-reactive with urinary immunoassay methods used for detecting opioids, resulting in false positive results. Use an alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) to confirm positive opioid urine drug screen results [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.19 )] .']","[""8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms in neonates with third trimester exposure. ( 8.1 ) Renal Impairment: Use is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including LYBALVI, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visit https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/atypicalantipsychotic/ . Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including the olanzapine component of LYBALVI, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations ) . Overall published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to olanzapine have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are no available data on the use of samidorphan or the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan in pregnant women to determine a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and with exposure to antipsychotics, including LYBALVI, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . LYBALVI In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of olanzapine and samidorphan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis produced adverse effects on embryofetal development and fetal toxicity at maternally toxic doses that are 6 times and >400 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/10 mg olanzapine/samidorphan in LYBALVI, respectively based on AUC. There were no adverse effects on embryofetal development at doses of olanzapine and samidorphan that are approximately 1 and 80 times, respectively, the MRHD based on AUC (see Data ) . Olanzapine In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of malformations in rats or rabbits when orally administered olanzapine at doses up to 9 and 30 times the MRHD dose (20 mg) based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively. In an oral rat embryofetal developmental toxicity study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose 9 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area and gestation was prolonged at 5 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area. In an oral rabbit embryofetal developmental toxicity study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of olanzapine which is 30 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area (see Data ) . Samidorphan In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of samidorphan to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused fetal toxicities in rats only at maternally toxic doses that are >248 times the human exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg/day based on AUC. Oral administration of samidorphan to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in lower pup survival and decreased pup weights at 188 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk There is risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization and suicide. Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/ Neonatal Risks Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including the olanzapine component of LYBALVI, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Human Data Published data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy do not report a clear association with antipsychotics and major birth defects. A retrospective cohort study from a Medicaid database of 9258 women exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy did not indicate an overall increased risk for major birth defects. Animal Data LYBALVI Olanzapine and samidorphan were orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 0.5/10, 2/50, 6/200, and 0/200 mg/kg/day (olanzapine/samidorphan) which are approximately <1/10 times to 6/448 times the MRHD of 20 mg/10 mg, olanzapine/samidorphan, respectively, based on AUC. Maternal toxicity consisting of decreased body weight and food consumption was observed at all dose levels. Administration of samidorphan alone (200 mg/kg/day) and 6/200 mg/kg/day olanzapine/samidorphan decreased mean fetal body weights, increased litter incidence of bent ribs and bent scapula; however, the incidence of bent scapula and bent ribs was not increased when samidorphan was administered in combination with olanzapine compared to the incidence with samidorphan alone. Administration of olanzapine/samidorphan at 6/200 mg/kg/day also increased resorptions and post-implantation loss, with correlating lower mean viable fetuses and litter size. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryofetal development is 2/50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 1/80 times the MRHD of 20 mg/10 mg olanzapine/samidorphan respectively, based on AUC. Olanzapine Olanzapine was orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day in rats and at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits (9 times and 30 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively), and no evidence of malformations was observed. In an oral rat embryofetal developmental toxicity study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). In an oral rabbit embryofetal developmental toxicity study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of olanzapine at 30 mg/kg/day (30 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Samidorphan Samidorphan was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 25, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 29 to 742 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day based on AUC. Samidorphan was associated with an increased incidence of skeletal variations (unossified sternebrae and bent ribs) at maternally toxic doses of ≥100 mg/kg/day, and skeletal malformations (bent or misshapen forelimbs, hindlimbs, and/or scapula) at 300 mg/kg/day which are >248 and 742 times the MRHD based on AUC, respectively. The NOAEL for embryofetal development is 25 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 29 times the MRHD based on AUC. Samidorphan did not cause adverse effects on embryofetal development when orally administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg/day, which are up to approximately 143 times the MRHD based on AUC. Samidorphan was orally administered to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 7 to 188 times the MRHD based on AUC. Reduced pup survival, lower birth weights, and decreased pup body weight gains were observed at 100 mg/kg/day, which is 188 times the MRHD based on AUC. The NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 36 times the MRHD based on AUC. There were no adverse effects on pup developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Olanzapine is present in human milk. There are reports of excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements) in infants exposed to olanzapine through breast milk. There is no information on the effects of olanzapine on milk production. There are no data on the presence of samidorphan or the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. When samidorphan was administered to lactating rats, samidorphan and a metabolite were detected in the plasma of nursing pups, likely due to the presence of samidorphan in milk. Infants exposed to LYBALVI should be monitored for excess sedation, irritability, poor feeding and extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors and abnormal muscle movements). The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for LYBALVI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LYBALVI or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Females Based on the pharmacologic action of olanzapine (D2 antagonism), treatment with LYBALVI may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels, which may lead to a reversible reduction in fertility in females of reproductive potential [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LYBALVI have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of LYBALVI did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they responded differently than younger adult patients. Olanzapine Of the 2,500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with orally administered olanzapine, 11% (263) were 65 years of age or over. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. LYBALVI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Studies in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine, compared to patients treated with placebo. In five placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (n=1,184), the following adverse reactions were reported in olanzapine-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% and significantly greater than in placebo-treated patients: falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was greater with olanzapine than with placebo (13% vs 7%). Consider a lower dosage of the olanzapine component of LYBALVI in geriatric patients who may have decreased clearance or an exaggerated pharmacodynamic response to olanzapine (e.g., oversedation) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Olanzapine and samidorphan plasma exposures were found to be higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function. The effect of severe hepatic impairment was not studied. The higher plasma exposure in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was not expected to be clinically relevant. No dose adjustment of LYBALVI is needed in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Plasma exposure to olanzapine and samidorphan was higher in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) compared to those with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment of LYBALVI is needed in patients with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ), moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ), or severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ). The effect of LYBALVI in patients with end-stage renal disease was not studied. LYBALVI is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR of <15 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ).""]","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including LYBALVI, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1-866-961-2388 or visit https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/atypicalantipsychotic/ . Risk Summary Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including the olanzapine component of LYBALVI, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations ) . Overall published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to olanzapine have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . There are no available data on the use of samidorphan or the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan in pregnant women to determine a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and with exposure to antipsychotics, including LYBALVI, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . LYBALVI In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of olanzapine and samidorphan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis produced adverse effects on embryofetal development and fetal toxicity at maternally toxic doses that are 6 times and >400 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/10 mg olanzapine/samidorphan in LYBALVI, respectively based on AUC. There were no adverse effects on embryofetal development at doses of olanzapine and samidorphan that are approximately 1 and 80 times, respectively, the MRHD based on AUC (see Data ) . Olanzapine In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of malformations in rats or rabbits when orally administered olanzapine at doses up to 9 and 30 times the MRHD dose (20 mg) based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively. In an oral rat embryofetal developmental toxicity study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose 9 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area and gestation was prolonged at 5 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area. In an oral rabbit embryofetal developmental toxicity study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of olanzapine which is 30 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area (see Data ) . Samidorphan In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of samidorphan to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused fetal toxicities in rats only at maternally toxic doses that are >248 times the human exposure at the MRHD of 10 mg/day based on AUC. Oral administration of samidorphan to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in lower pup survival and decreased pup weights at 188 times the human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk There is risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization and suicide. Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors. Fetal/ Neonatal Risks Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including the olanzapine component of LYBALVI, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms have varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization. Data Human Data Published data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy do not report a clear association with antipsychotics and major birth defects. A retrospective cohort study from a Medicaid database of 9258 women exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy did not indicate an overall increased risk for major birth defects. Animal Data LYBALVI Olanzapine and samidorphan were orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 0.5/10, 2/50, 6/200, and 0/200 mg/kg/day (olanzapine/samidorphan) which are approximately <1/10 times to 6/448 times the MRHD of 20 mg/10 mg, olanzapine/samidorphan, respectively, based on AUC. Maternal toxicity consisting of decreased body weight and food consumption was observed at all dose levels. Administration of samidorphan alone (200 mg/kg/day) and 6/200 mg/kg/day olanzapine/samidorphan decreased mean fetal body weights, increased litter incidence of bent ribs and bent scapula; however, the incidence of bent scapula and bent ribs was not increased when samidorphan was administered in combination with olanzapine compared to the incidence with samidorphan alone. Administration of olanzapine/samidorphan at 6/200 mg/kg/day also increased resorptions and post-implantation loss, with correlating lower mean viable fetuses and litter size. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryofetal development is 2/50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 1/80 times the MRHD of 20 mg/10 mg olanzapine/samidorphan respectively, based on AUC. Olanzapine Olanzapine was orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day in rats and at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits (9 times and 30 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively), and no evidence of malformations was observed. In an oral rat embryofetal developmental toxicity study, early resorptions and increased numbers of nonviable fetuses were observed at a dose of 18 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Gestation was prolonged at 10 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). In an oral rabbit embryofetal developmental toxicity study, fetal toxicity (manifested as increased resorptions and decreased fetal weight) occurred at a maternally toxic dose of olanzapine at 30 mg/kg/day (30 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Samidorphan Samidorphan was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 25, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 29 to 742 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day based on AUC. Samidorphan was associated with an increased incidence of skeletal variations (unossified sternebrae and bent ribs) at maternally toxic doses of ≥100 mg/kg/day, and skeletal malformations (bent or misshapen forelimbs, hindlimbs, and/or scapula) at 300 mg/kg/day which are >248 and 742 times the MRHD based on AUC, respectively. The NOAEL for embryofetal development is 25 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 29 times the MRHD based on AUC. Samidorphan did not cause adverse effects on embryofetal development when orally administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 10, 30, and 90 mg/kg/day, which are up to approximately 143 times the MRHD based on AUC. Samidorphan was orally administered to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 7 to 188 times the MRHD based on AUC. Reduced pup survival, lower birth weights, and decreased pup body weight gains were observed at 100 mg/kg/day, which is 188 times the MRHD based on AUC. The NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day is approximately 36 times the MRHD based on AUC. There were no adverse effects on pup developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility.']",[],['8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LYBALVI have not been established in pediatric patients.'],"['8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of LYBALVI did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they responded differently than younger adult patients. Olanzapine Of the 2,500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with orally administered olanzapine, 11% (263) were 65 years of age or over. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. LYBALVI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

The mechanism of action of samidorphan could be mediated through opioid receptor antagonism. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Olanzapine Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors: serotonin 5HT 2A/2C , 5HT 6 (K i =4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D 1-4 (K i =11–31 nM), histamine H 1 (K i =7 nM), and adrenergic α 1 receptors (K i =19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT 3 (K i =57 nM) and muscarinic M 1-5 (K i =73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds with low affinity to GABA A , BZD, and β-adrenergic receptors (K i >10 μM). Samidorphan Samidorphan binds to the mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors (K i =0.052, 0.23, and 2.7 nM, respectively). Samidorphan is an antagonist at the mu-opioid receptors with partial agonist activity at kappa- and delta-opioid receptors. The N-dealkylated major human metabolite binds to the mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors (K i =0.26, 23, and 56 nM, respectively), and functions as a mu-opioid receptor agonist. The N-oxide major human metabolite binds to mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors (K i =8, 110, and 280 nM, respectively) and functions as a mu-opioid receptor antagonist. Cardiac Electrophysiology At doses up to 30 mg/30 mg (1.5 times and 3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of olanzapine and samidorphan, respectively), LYBALVI does not prolong QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of both olanzapine and samidorphan are linear over the clinical dose range and there is no PK interaction between olanzapine and samidorphan after oral administration of LYBALVI. Steady-state concentrations of olanzapine and samidorphan are reached within 7 days of commencement of once-daily administration of LYBALVI. The primary pharmacological activities of LYBALVI are due to the parent drugs, olanzapine and samidorphan. Following a single dose administration of LYBALVI (10 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan), the mean AUC 0-inf and C max of olanzapine was 628 ng·h/mL and 16 ng/mL, respectively. The mean AUC 0-inf and C max of olanzapine after 10 mg single dose administration of olanzapine tablet was 610 ng·h/mL and 16 ng/mL, respectively.

In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly subjects (≥65 years) than in non-elderly subjects (<65 years). No effect of age on samidorphan pharmacokinetics was found in a study involving 12 elderly [aged 66-80 years old (6 male, 6 female)] and 24 young [aged 18-39 years old (12 male, 12 female)] healthy subjects administered a single oral dose of 10 mg samidorphan. Male and Female Patients Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in females than males. In clinical trials, however, there were no apparent differences between males and females in efficacy or adverse reactions. In clinical studies and population pharmacokinetic analysis, LYBALVI pharmacokinetics were consistent with that of olanzapine (as monotherapy) with no apparent effect of sex on samidorphan pharmacokinetics. Racial or Ethnic Groups In vivo studies of olanzapine as monotherapy have shown that olanzapine exposures are similar among Japanese, Chinese, and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight difference. A population pharmacokinetic analysis found that the clearance of olanzapine is greater in Black subjects (N=255) than non-Black subjects (N=329 White and N=17 other races), and that samidorphan pharmacokinetics are not affected by race. Patients with Hepatic and Renal Impairment Effects of hepatic and renal impairment on the exposure of olanzapine and samidorphan are summarized in Figure 1 . Figure 1: Effects of Hepatic Impairment and Renal Impairment on Olanzapine and Samidorphan Pharmacokinetics * Based on PBPK simulations, the predicted C max and AUC ratios for samidorphan in subjects with severe hepatic impairment relative to healthy subjects were 2.1 and 2.3, respectively. Figure 1 Smoking Status Olanzapine clearance was approximately 40% higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Samidorphan pharmacokinetics were not affected by smoking. Combined Effects The combined effects of age, smoking, and sex could lead to substantial difference in olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The clearance of olanzapine in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that samidorphan pharmacokinetics was not affected by age, sex, race, and smoking status. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on LYBALVI Coadministration of LYBALVI with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased the total systemic exposure (based on area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUC inf ]) of olanzapine and samidorphan by 48% and 73%, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine C max following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC in female nonsmokers and male smokers is 52% and 108%, respectively. Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increased clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a CYP1A2 inducer. Based on PBPK simulations, Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, is predicted to increase samidorphan C max by 25% and AUC by 56%. Figure 2: Effect of Other Drugs on LYBALVI Figure 2 Effect of LYBALVI on Other Drugs Coadministration of LYBALVI and lithium or valproate did not have a clinically significant effect on the PK of lithium or valproate ( Figure 3 ). Based on these results, no dosage adjustment of lithium or valproate is necessary when coadministered with LYBALVI.

Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on LYBALVI Coadministration of LYBALVI with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased the total systemic exposure (based on area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUC inf ]) of olanzapine and samidorphan by 48% and 73%, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine C max following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC in female nonsmokers and male smokers is 52% and 108%, respectively. Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increased clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a CYP1A2 inducer. Based on PBPK simulations, Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, is predicted to increase samidorphan C max by 25% and AUC by 56%. Figure 2: Effect of Other Drugs on LYBALVI Figure 2 Effect of LYBALVI on Other Drugs Coadministration of LYBALVI and lithium or valproate did not have a clinically significant effect on the PK of lithium or valproate ( Figure 3 ). Based on these results, no dosage adjustment of lithium or valproate is necessary when coadministered with LYBALVI. Figure 3: Effect of LYBALVI on Other Drugs Figure 3 In vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes : Olanzapine does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5.

Transporter Systems: Samidorphan is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp; multidrug resistance protein 1), organic anion transporter (OATP) 1B1, or OATP1B3. Samidorphan does not inhibit these transporters or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, or organic cation transporter (OCT)2.""]","[""13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Olanzapine Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78-week studies at doses of 3, 10, 30/20 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.8 to 5 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area) and 0.25, 2, 8 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.06 to 2 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5, 4 mg/kg/day (males) and 0.25, 1, 4, 8 mg/kg/day (females) (equivalent to 0.13 to 2 and 0.13 to 4 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice dosed at 8 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed at 10 or 30/20 mg/kg/day (2 to 5 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area); in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 30/20 mg/kg/day group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at ≥2 mg/kg/day and in female rats dosed at ≥4 mg/kg/day (0.5 and 2 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4-fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )] . Samidorphan Samidorphan did not increase the incidence of tumors in rats administered oral doses of 20, 35, or 75 mg/kg/day (males) and 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day (females) for 96 (males) and 95 (females) weeks, which are up to 32 and 237 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day in males and females, respectively based on AUC. Samidorphan did not increase the incidence of tumors in transgenic rasH2 mice administered oral doses of 125, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks. Mutagenesis Olanzapine No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the Ames reverse mutation test, in vivo micronucleus test in mice, the chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or in vivo sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters. Samidorphan No evidence of genotoxicity of samidorphan was found in the in vitro Ames bacterial reverse mutation test, the in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Impairment of Fertility Olanzapine In an oral fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, male mating performance, but not fertility, was impaired at a dose of 22.4 mg/kg/day and female fertility was decreased at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (11 and 1.5 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day based on mg/m 2 body surface area, respectively). Discontinuance of olanzapine treatment reversed the effects on male mating performance. In female rats, the precoital period was increased and the mating index reduced at 5 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area). Diestrus was prolonged and estrus delayed at 1.1 mg/kg/day (0.6 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area); therefore, olanzapine may produce a delay in ovulation. Samidorphan Samidorphan did not impair fertility when administered orally to female rats at doses of 30, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation day 7. The doses are approximately 32, 297, and >680 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day based on AUC, respectively. However, estrous cycle lengths were increased, and the total number of estrous cycles were decreased in females at the highest dose of 450 mg/kg/day. Samidorphan did not affect fertility when orally administered to male rats at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating; the highest dose is approximately 16 times the MRHD based on AUC. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Olanzapine In animal studies with olanzapine, the principal hematologic findings were reversible peripheral cytopenia in individual dogs dosed at 10 mg/kg (17 times the MRHD of 20 mg olanzapine based on mg/m 2 body surface area), dose-related decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in mice, and lymphopenia in rats. A few dogs treated with 10 mg/kg developed reversible neutropenia and/or reversible hemolytic anemia between 1 and 10 months of treatment. Dose-related decreases in lymphocytes and neutrophils were seen in mice given doses of 10 mg/kg (equal to 2 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area) in studies of 3 months' duration. Nonspecific lymphopenia, consistent with decreased body weight gain, occurred in rats receiving 22.5 mg/kg (11 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area) for 3 months or 16 mg/kg (8 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 body surface area) for 6 or 12 months. No evidence of bone marrow cytotoxicity was found in any of the species examined. Bone marrows were normocellular or hypercellular, indicating that the reductions in circulating blood cells were probably due to peripheral (non-marrow) factors.""]","['13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Olanzapine Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats.

Efficacy of LYBALVI was also evaluated in a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study (Study 1). In Study 1 (NCT02634346), adult patients who met DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to LYBALVI, olanzapine, or placebo for 4 weeks of daily dosing. Dosing was flexible based on clinical response and tolerability for the first 2 weeks of the study; doses thereafter were fixed. Patients assigned to LYBALVI could receive either 10 mg/10 mg or 20 mg/10 mg, and patients assigned to olanzapine could receive either 10 mg or 20 mg. The study was designed to compare LYBALVI with placebo, not with olanzapine. Eligible patients were 18 to 70 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0–40.0 kg/m 2 , Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of ≥80, and a score of ≥4 on at least 3 of the selected Positive Scale items. Patients were also required to have a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score ≥4. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 4. The PANSS is a 30-item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). Total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210, with a higher score reflecting greater symptom severity. The secondary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change from baseline in CGI-S score at Week 4. The CGI-S is a validated scale that requires clinicians to rate a patient's current illness severity and overall clinical state based on experience with the illness population. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill). Compared with patients on placebo, a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 4 was observed in patients treated with LYBALVI ( Table 7 ). The inclusion of samidorphan in LYBALVI did not appear to negatively impact the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine.

Figure 4 Evaluation of Weight Changes in Patients with Schizophrenia In Study 2 (NCT02694328), adult patients who met DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to LYBALVI or olanzapine for 24 weeks of daily dosing. Dosing was flexible for the first 4 weeks of the study, and doses were fixed thereafter. Patients were treated with doses of LYBALVI of 10 mg/10 mg or 20 mg/10 mg, or with doses of olanzapine of 10 mg or 20 mg. Eligible patients were 18 to 55 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m 2 , PANSS total score of 50 to 90, CGI-S score of ≤4, and symptoms suitable for outpatient treatment; patients with diabetes mellitus were excluded. The proportions of patients who discontinued study drug in the 24-week trial was 36% for both the LYBALVI and olanzapine-treated groups. Weight Gain The co-primary endpoints were percent change from baseline in body weight and the proportion of patients who gained ≥10% body weight at Week 24. LYBALVI was compared to olanzapine for each co-primary endpoint [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Patients on stable, chronic olanzapine therapy were not specifically studied, so the weight effect of switching from olanzapine to LYBALVI is unknown. Treatment with LYBALVI was associated with statistically significantly less weight gain than treatment with olanzapine, and with a smaller proportion of patients who gained ≥10% body weight ( Table 8 ). Figure 5 displays the percent change in body weight over time.

Figure 5 14.2 Bipolar I Disorder The efficacy of LYBALVI in the treatment of adult patients with bipolar I disorder has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of orally administered olanzapine. The information below describes the results of adequate and well-controlled studies of olanzapine in patients with bipolar I disorder. Monotherapy The efficacy of oral olanzapine in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 short-term (one 3-week and one 4-week) placebo-controlled studies in adult patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These studies included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course. The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these studies was the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these studies was change from baseline in the Y-MRS total score. The results of the studies follow: In one 3-week placebo-controlled study (n=67) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5 mg/day to 20 mg/day, once daily, starting at 10 mg/day), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score. In an identically designed study conducted simultaneously with the first study olanzapine demonstrated a similar treatment difference but, possibly due to sample size and site variability, was not shown to be superior to placebo on this outcome. In a 4-week placebo-controlled study (n=115) which involved a dose range of olanzapine (5 mg/day to 20 mg/day, once daily, starting at 15 mg/day), olanzapine was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score. In another study, 361 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder who had responded during an initial open-label treatment phase for about 2 weeks, on average, to olanzapine 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day were randomized to either continuation of olanzapine at their same dose (n=225) or to placebo (n=136), for observation of relapse. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the olanzapine group by day 59 and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 23 of double-blind treatment. Response during the open-label phase was defined by having a decrease of the Y-MRS total score to ≤12 and HAM-D 21 to ≤8. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the Y-MRS or HAM-D 21 total score to ≥15, or being hospitalized for either mania or depression. In the randomized phase, patients receiving continued olanzapine experienced a significantly longer time to relapse. Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate The efficacy of oral olanzapine with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes was established in 2 controlled studies in patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes. These studies included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course. The results of the studies follow: In one 6-week placebo-controlled combination study, 175 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (Y-MRS ≥16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Olanzapine (in a dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day, once daily, starting at 10 mg/day) combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.2 mEq/L or 50 μg/mL to 125 μg/mL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of Y-MRS total score. In a second 6-week placebo-controlled combination study, 169 outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms (Y-MRS ≥16) were randomized to receive either olanzapine or placebo, in combination with their original therapy.

In premarketing clinical trials of LYBALVI involving 861 patients, overdose of LYBALVI was identified in 7 patients. This included 4 patients with accidental overdose, 2 with intentional overdose, and 1 due to a medication administration error. None of the reported overdoses was associated with a fatal outcome. There was a reported ingestion of 11 tablets of LYBALVI 10 mg/10 mg (5.5 times and 11 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of the olanzapine and samidorphan components of LYBALVI, respectively). The patient was found unresponsive and admitted to the hospital. Medical treatment included fluids, electrolytes, a diuretic, and a detoxicant; the patient stabilized within 2 days. In postmarketing reports of overdose with olanzapine, a component of LYBALVI, symptoms included agitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, tachycardia, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma. Less commonly reported symptoms include: aspiration, cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrhythmias (such as supraventricular tachycardia and 1 patient experiencing sinus pause with spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), delirium, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression/arrest, convulsion, hypertension, and hypotension. In 1 case of death, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was reported to be possibly as low as 450 mg; however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive an acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2,000 mg. Management of Overdose No specific antidotes for LYBALVI are known. In managing overdose, provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring, and consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. If an overdose occurs, consult a certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for additional overdosage management recommendations.']","[""This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Revised: 1/2024 MEDICATION GUIDE LYBALVI ® (lee bawl' vee) (olanzapine and samidorphan) tablets, for oral use If your healthcare provider prescribes LYBALVI in combination with valproate or lithium, also read the Medication Guide that comes with those medicines.

EXXUA is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults ( 1 ).'],"['2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Correct electrolyte abnormalities and perform electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiating treatment with EXXUA. Do not initiate EXXUA if QTc is > 450 msec ( 2.1 ). Perform ECGs during dosage titration and periodically during treatment ( 2.1 ). The recommended starting dose is 18.2 mg administered orally once daily with food at approximately the same time each day ( 2.2 , 2.3 ). Depending on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 36.3 mg once daily on Day 4. Dosage may be further titrated to 54.5 mg once daily after Day 7 and to 72.6 mg once daily after an additional week ( 2.3 ). Geriatric patients: Recommended starting dosage is 18.2 mg once daily. Dosage may be increased to 36.3 mg after 7 days ( 2.4 ). Renal Impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min): Recommended starting dosage is 18.2 mg once daily. Dosage may be increased to 36.3 mg once daily after 7 days ( 2.5 , 8.6 ). Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh B): Dosage may be increased to 36.3 mg once daily after 7 days ( 2.6 , 8.7 ). Adjust EXXUA dose by 50% when a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is administered ( 2.7 ). 2.1 Important Recommendations Prior to Initiating and During Treatment with EXXUA Electrocardiogram and Electrolyte Monitoring Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating EXXUA. In patients with electrolyte abnormalities, or who are receiving diuretics or glucocorticoids, or who have a history of hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, also monitor electrolytes during dose titration and periodically during treatment with EXXUA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiating EXXUA, during dosage titration, and periodically during treatment. Do not initiate EXXUA if QTc is > 450 msec at baseline. Monitor ECGs more frequently if EXXUA is used: concomitantly with drugs known to prolong the QT interval in patients who develop QTc ≥ 450 msec during treatment in patients with a significant risk of developing torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Do not escalate the EXXUA dosage if the QTcF is > 450 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Bipolar Disorder, Mania, and Hypomania Screening Screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania prior to initiating treatment with EXXUA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 2.2 Important Administration Instructions Take EXXUA orally with food at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Swallow tablets whole. Do not split, crush, or chew EXXUA. 2.3 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage of EXXUA is 18.2 mg once daily. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 36.3 mg orally once daily on Day 4 and further titrated to 54.5 mg orally once daily after Day 7 and to 72.6 mg orally once daily after an additional week. The maximum recommended daily dosage of EXXUA is 72.6 mg once daily. 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients The recommended starting dosage of EXXUA in geriatric patients is 18.2 mg orally once daily. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to maximum recommended dosage of 36.3 mg orally once daily after Day 7 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment The recommended starting dosage of EXXUA in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min is 18.2 mg orally once daily. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage of 36.3 mg orally once daily after Day 7 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended dosage in patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min is the same as in patients with normal renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting dose of EXXUA in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment is 18.2 mg once daily. Based on clinical response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage of 36.3 mg orally once daily after Day 7 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. EXXUA is contraindicated in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended dosage in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment is the same as patients with normal hepatic function. 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors Reduce the EXXUA dose by 50% when used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7)] . EXXUA is contraindicated in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)] . 2.8 Switching a Patient to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with EXXUA. Conversely, at least 14 days must be allowed after stopping EXXUA before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ].']","['3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS EXXUA is available as extended-release tablets in the following strengths, as gepirone base: 18.2 mg: pink, modified rectangular, with “FK” debossed on one side and “1” on the other side. 36.3 mg: off-white, modified rectangular, with “FK” debossed on one side and “7” on the other side. 54.5 mg: yellow, modified rectangular, with “FK” debossed on one side and “11” on the other side. 72.6 mg: red-brown, modified rectangular, with “FK” debossed on one side and “17” on the other side.

Starting EXXUA in a patient treated with reversible MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated. Known hypersensitivity to gepirone or components of EXXUA ( 4 ). Prolonged QTc interval > 450 msec at baseline ( 4 ). Congenital long QT syndrome ( 4 ). Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( 4 ). Severe hepatic impairment ( 4 ). Use with an MAOI or within 14 days of stopping treatment with EXXUA. Do not use EXXUA within 14 days of discontinuing an MAOI ( 4 ).']","['5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT Interval Prolongation: EXXUA prolongs the QTc. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Perform ECGs prior to initiation, during dose titration, and periodically during treatment with EXXUA. Monitor ECGs more frequently when EXXUA is used concomitantly with drugs known to prolong the QT interval, in patients who develop QTc ≥ 450 msec during treatment or are at significant risk of developing torsade de pointes. Do not escalate dosage if QTc > 450 msec ( 2.1 , 5.2 , 7 ). Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue EXXUA and initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ). Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients aged 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1 . Table 1 Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric* and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 years old 14 additional patients 18-24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 years old 1 fewer patient ≥ 65 years old 6 fewer patients *EXXUA is not approved for use in pediatric patients. It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing EXXUA, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 QT Prolongation EXXUA prolongs the QTc interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . EXXUA is contraindicated in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors as they increase EXXUA plasma concentrations [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Do not initiate EXXUA if QTc is > 450 msec at baseline [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Contraindications (4) ] . Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to EXXUA initiation. In patients with electrolyte abnormalities, who are receiving diuretics or glucocorticoids, or have a history or hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, also monitor electrolytes during dose titration and periodically during treatment with EXXUA. Perform an ECG prior to EXXUA initiation, during dosage titration, and periodically during treatment. Monitor patients with ECGs more frequently. If EXXUA is used concomitantly with drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see Drug Interactions (7)] . In patients who develop QTc ≥ 450 msec during treatment with EXXUA. Do not escalate the EXXUA dosage if QTcF is > 450 msec [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . In patients with a significant risk of developing torsade de pointes, including those with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, recent myocardial infarction, heart failure, unstable angina, bradyarrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, high degree atrioventricular block, severe aortic stenosis, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism. Reduce the EXXUA dosage when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, as they may increase EXXUA concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Serotonin Syndrome Concomitant use of EXXUA with SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants may cause serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition with changes including altered mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The concomitant use of EXXUA with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate EXXUA in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking EXXUA discontinue EXXUA before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. If concomitant use of EXXUA with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. Discontinue EXXUA and/or concomitant serotonergic drug immediately if the above symptoms occur and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. 5.4 Activation of Mania/Hypomania Antidepressant treatment can precipitate a manic, mixed, or hypomanic manic episode. The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with EXXUA, screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, suicide, or depression) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . EXXUA is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.']","['6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] QT Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Activation of Mania or Hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Most common adverse reactions (incidence of ≥5% and at least twice incidence of placebo) were dizziness, nausea, insomnia, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fabre-Kramer at 713-975-6900 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During premarketing assessment, multiple doses of EXXUA were administered to 1,976 adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in controlled phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, including 1,639 patients in placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 trials in MDD, with 237 patients exposed for over six months. The population treated with EXXUA in the pooled placebo-controlled studies ranged from 15 to 78 years of age, was 34% male and 66% female, and was 80% Caucasian, 11% Black, and 9% other race. The adverse reaction data below are based on two placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, clinical studies (Study 1, Study 2) in which either EXXUA 18.2 mg to 72.6 mg (n=226) or placebo (n=230) was administered to adult patients with MDD during an 8-week double-blind treatment period [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Study 1 had a median age of 39 years and were 61% female, 73% Caucasian, 9% Black, 2% Asian, and 16% Other (Hispanic or Native American). Study 2 had a median age of 39 years and were 69% female, 65% Caucasian, 23% Black, 1% Asian, and 11% Hispanic. In Study 1 and Study 2, 7% (15/226) of patients treated with EXXUA and 3% (6/230) of patients receiving placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. The most common reactions leading to discontinuation for patients taking EXXUA were dizziness and nausea. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5% and twice the incidence of placebo) in EXXUA-treated patients were dizziness, nausea, insomnia, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia. Table 2 presents the adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 2% of patients treated with EXXUA and at a higher incidence than in the placebo-treated patients.

Table 3 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with EXXUA CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of EXXUA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases EXXUA exposure by ~ 5-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increases EXXUA exposure by ~ 2.6-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Intervention Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors EXXUA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Contraindications (4) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors If EXXUA is used with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce the dosage of EXXUA [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact Concomitant use EXXUA with MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention EXXUA is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue or in patients who have taken MAOIs within the preceding 14 days. Allow at least 14 days after stopping EXXUA before starting an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Contraindications (4) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval Clinical Impact Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval may add to the QTc prolonging effects of EXXUA and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Intervention Monitor patients with ECGs more frequently if EXXUA is administered with other drugs known to prolong QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Concomitant use of EXXUA with a strong CYP3A4 inducers reduces EXXUA exposure by 20- to 29-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Intervention Avoid concomitant use of EXXUA in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inducers. Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact Concomitant use of EXXUA and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome when EXXUA is used concomitantly with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of EXXUA and/or concomitant serotonergic drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Reduces EXXUA exposure. Avoid concomitant use ( 7 ).']","['8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Third trimester use may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants, including EXXUA, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants/. Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies, gepirone has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development. In rats, increased mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent reduction in body weight through lactation and weaning were observed at all doses and increased still births were seen with a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) at 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis. In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, decreased embryofetal growth, body weights and lengths, with accompanying skeletal variations were seen with a NOAEL at 9 and 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data) . There are insufficient clinical data on gepirone use during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are clinical considerations regarding neonates exposed to serotonergic antidepressants during the third trimester of pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations and Data) . There are risks associated with untreated depression during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . Consider if the risks outweigh the benefits of treatment with gepirone during pregnancy. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective, longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Neonates exposed to other serotonergic antidepressants in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremors, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Data Human Data Exposure during late pregnancy to serotonergic antidepressants may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1- 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Animal Data In embryofetal development studies, oral administration of gepirone to pregnant rats (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg) or pregnant rabbits (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryofetal growth, body weights and lengths, with accompanying skeletal variations at mid and high doses; the mid doses are 18 and 24 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis in rats and rabbits, respectively. No malformations were seen in these studies. The developmental NOAEL was 9 and 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis in rats and rabbits, respectively. When pregnant rats were treated with gepirone (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) from late gestation through weaning, decreased birth weights were seen at mid and high doses; the mid dose is twice the MRHD. Increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent reduction in body weight were observed at all doses; the lowest dose is approximately equal to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for fetal effects was not determined in this study. When gepirone was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout mating, gestation, and lactation at doses of 5, 27, 64, and 150 mg/kg/day. Increased still births were seen at ≥64 mg/kg. Early postnatal mortality was increased at 150 mg/kg (18 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The NOAEL (27 mg/kg) for still births was associated with a maternal dose 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Fetal weights were decreased at 27 mg/kg (3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and fetal lengths were decreased at 64 mg/kg (8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and above. Pup weights were decreased at birth, throughout lactation and weaning, and until at least 14 weeks of age, with delays of some developmental landmarks, at 64 mg/kg and above. The NOAEL for growth and development (5 mg/kg) was associated with a maternal dose below the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of gepirone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Gepirone is present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to other serotonergic antidepressants experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for EXXUA and any adverse effects on the breastfed infant from EXXUA or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EXXUA in pediatric patients have not been established for the treatment of MDD. Efficacy was not demonstrated in two 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 426 pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with MDD. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from double-blind baseline to Week 8 on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) measure. The effect of treatment with EXXUA was not significantly different from placebo. In the pediatric trial patients, there was a higher occurrence of vomiting in pediatric patients (13%) compared adults (6.6%). Antidepressants, such as EXXUA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile animal study, male and female rats were treated with gepirone once daily with oral doses of 0, 10, 40, and 70 mg/kg, from postnatal day 14 to 42. Increased motor activity and impaired performance in the Morris water maze were observed at 40 and 70 mg/kg after a two-week recovery period. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the neurobehavioral development effect was 10 mg/kg. When the animals were mated after a 3-week recovery period, increased pre-implantation loss was observed for mated pairs treated with 70 mg/kg. The NOAEL for this finding was 40 mg/kg/day. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1,639 patients exposed to EXXUA in placebo-controlled clinical studies of MDD, 0.7% (12 patients) were 65 years of age or older and 0.2% (3 patients) were 75 years or older. Geriatric patients (65 to 81 years of age) had higher EXXUA AUC and C max values than younger adult (18 to 40 years of age) patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The maximum recommended daily dosage of EXXUA in geriatric patients is lower than in younger adult patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, the metabolism and excretion of EXXUA and some of its major metabolites were decreased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The maximum recommended daily dosage of EXXUA in patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min is lower than in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . The recommended dosage in patients with a creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min is the same as in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) hepatic impairment to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the metabolism of EXXUA and its major metabolites was decreased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The maximum recommended dosage of EXXUA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is lower than in patients with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . The recommended dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment is the same as in patients with normal hepatic function. EXXUA is contraindicated in patients with severe (Child- Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .']","['8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants, including EXXUA, during pregnancy.

In rats, increased mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent reduction in body weight through lactation and weaning were observed at all doses and increased still births were seen with a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) at 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m 2 basis. In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, decreased embryofetal growth, body weights and lengths, with accompanying skeletal variations were seen with a NOAEL at 9 and 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis, respectively (see Data) . There are insufficient clinical data on gepirone use during pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are clinical considerations regarding neonates exposed to serotonergic antidepressants during the third trimester of pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations and Data) . There are risks associated with untreated depression during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . Consider if the risks outweigh the benefits of treatment with gepirone during pregnancy. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective, longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Neonates exposed to other serotonergic antidepressants in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremors, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Data Human Data Exposure during late pregnancy to serotonergic antidepressants may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1- 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Animal Data In embryofetal development studies, oral administration of gepirone to pregnant rats (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg) or pregnant rabbits (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryofetal growth, body weights and lengths, with accompanying skeletal variations at mid and high doses; the mid doses are 18 and 24 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis in rats and rabbits, respectively. No malformations were seen in these studies. The developmental NOAEL was 9 and 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis in rats and rabbits, respectively. When pregnant rats were treated with gepirone (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) from late gestation through weaning, decreased birth weights were seen at mid and high doses; the mid dose is twice the MRHD. Increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent reduction in body weight were observed at all doses; the lowest dose is approximately equal to the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for fetal effects was not determined in this study. When gepirone was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout mating, gestation, and lactation at doses of 5, 27, 64, and 150 mg/kg/day. Increased still births were seen at ≥64 mg/kg. Early postnatal mortality was increased at 150 mg/kg (18 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). The NOAEL (27 mg/kg) for still births was associated with a maternal dose 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Fetal weights were decreased at 27 mg/kg (3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and fetal lengths were decreased at 64 mg/kg (8 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and above. Pup weights were decreased at birth, throughout lactation and weaning, and until at least 14 weeks of age, with delays of some developmental landmarks, at 64 mg/kg and above. The NOAEL for growth and development (5 mg/kg) was associated with a maternal dose below the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis.']",[],"['8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EXXUA in pediatric patients have not been established for the treatment of MDD. Efficacy was not demonstrated in two 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 426 pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with MDD. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from double-blind baseline to Week 8 on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) measure. The effect of treatment with EXXUA was not significantly different from placebo. In the pediatric trial patients, there was a higher occurrence of vomiting in pediatric patients (13%) compared adults (6.6%). Antidepressants, such as EXXUA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile animal study, male and female rats were treated with gepirone once daily with oral doses of 0, 10, 40, and 70 mg/kg, from postnatal day 14 to 42. Increased motor activity and impaired performance in the Morris water maze were observed at 40 and 70 mg/kg after a two-week recovery period. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the neurobehavioral development effect was 10 mg/kg. When the animals were mated after a 3-week recovery period, increased pre-implantation loss was observed for mated pairs treated with 70 mg/kg. The NOAEL for this finding was 40 mg/kg/day.']","['8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1,639 patients exposed to EXXUA in placebo-controlled clinical studies of MDD, 0.7% (12 patients) were 65 years of age or older and 0.2% (3 patients) were 75 years or older. Geriatric patients (65 to 81 years of age) had higher EXXUA AUC and C max values than younger adult (18 to 40 years of age) patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The maximum recommended daily dosage of EXXUA in geriatric patients is lower than in younger adult patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .']","['11 DESCRIPTION EXXUA contains gepirone, in the salt form as gepirone hydrochloride (HCl). The chemical name is 2,6- piperidinedione,4,4-dimethyl-1-[4-[4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]-, monohydrochloride. The molecular weight of gepirone HCl is 395.93 and the structural formula is as follows: Gepirone HCl is a white to off-white crystalline powder, which is readily soluble in water. EXXUA is supplied as extended-release tablets for oral administration. Each extended-release tablet contains 18.2 mg, 36.3 mg, 54.5 mg, or 72.6 mg, gepirone equivalent to 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg of gepirone HCl respectively. The extended-release tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, Hypromellose, iron oxide (red and/or yellow colorants), magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. Chemical Structure Diagram']","['12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of the antidepressant effect of EXXUA is not fully understood but is thought to be related to its modulation of serotonergic activity in the CNS through selective agonist activity at 5HT1A receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacological activity of gepirone is attributed to the parent drug and its major metabolites 3’-OH-gepirone and 1-PP. Gepirone and its 3’-OH metabolite bind to 5HT1A receptors (Ki = 38 nM and 58 nM, respectively), where they act as agonists, while the 1-PP metabolite binds to alpha2 receptors (Ki = 42 nM). Cardiac Electrophysiology In a thorough QT study, the largest mean increase in baseline- and placebo-corrected QTc interval with administration of 100 mg per day immediate-release formulation of gepirone was 18.4 msec (upper 90% confidence interval [CI] = 22.7 ms) on Day 1 and 16.1 msec (upper 90% CI = 20.7 ms) on Day 7. The exposure in this study was 2-fold the exposure of the maximum recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of EXXUA are linear and dose proportional from 18.2 mg to 72.6 mg. Steady-state plasma concentration are typically achieved within two to four days of daily dosing. Absorption The absolute bioavailability is 14% to 17%. The maximal plasma EXXUA concentration (C max ) after dosing is reached within 6 hours post dose (T max ). Effect of Food After a high fat meal, T max is reached at 3 hours. A significant effect of food has been observed on the peak plasma concentration (C max ) of EXXUA and, to a lesser extent, on the total exposure (AUC0-tlast, AUC0-∞) to EXXUA. The magnitude of the food-effect was dependent of the fat content of the meal. The systemic exposure of EXXUA and major metabolites was consistently higher under fed conditions as compared to the fasted state. Gepirone Cmax after intake of low-fat (~ 200 calories) breakfast was 27% higher, after medium-fat (~500 calories) breakfast 55% higher and after a high-fat (~ 850 calories) breakfast 62% higher as compared to the fasted state. The AUC after intake of low-fat breakfast was about 14% higher, after a medium-fat breakfast 22% higher and after a high-fat breakfast 32 to 37% higher as compared to the fasted state. The effect of varying amounts of fat on C max and AUC of the major metabolites 3-OH-gepirone and 1PP were similar to that found for gepirone [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of EXXUA is approximately 94.5L. The in vitro plasma protein binding in human is 72% and is not concentration dependent. The in vitro plasma protein binding for metabolite 3’-OH gepirone is 59% and 42% for 1-PP. Elimination The mean terminal half-life is approximately 5 hours. Metabolism EXXUA is extensively metabolized and both major metabolites 1-PP and 3’-OH-gepirone are present in plasma in higher concentrations than the parent compound. CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of EXXUA to its major pharmacologically active metabolites. Excretion Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C]-labeled gepirone, approximately 81% and 13% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively as metabolites. 60% of the gepirone was eliminated in the urine within the first 24 hours. The presence of hepatic or renal impairment did affect the apparent clearance of EXXUA. Specific Populations Exposures of gepirone in specific populations are summarized in Figure 1 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ), Contraindications (4) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Drug Interactions Studies In Vivo Studies The effect of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of gepirone is summarized in Figure 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Rifampin The effect of multiple oral dosing of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer rifampin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of EXXUA and its major metabolites 1-PP and 3’-OH-gepirone was investigated in 24 subjects. Combined therapy with rifampin (600 mg daily) and EXXUA (20 mg for two days, then 40 mg daily) decreased C max and AUC0-24 of EXXUA 20 times (EXXUA C max alone 9.63 ng/mL, with rifampin 0.491 ng/mL) and 29 times (EXXUA AUC0-24 alone 123 ng·hr/mL, with rifampin 4.19 ng·hr/mL), respectively. The C max and AUC0-24 of 3’-OH gepirone were decreased 2.5 times (3’-OH gepirone C max alone 23.0 ng/mL, with rifampin 9.30 ng/mL) and three times (3’-OH gepirone AUC0-24 alone 371 ng·hr/mL, with rifampin 126 ng·hr/mL), respectively. There was no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 1-PP (1-PP C max alone 6.37 ng/mL, with rifampin 6.02 ng/mL; 1-PP AUC0-24 alone 92.5 ng·hr/mL, with rifampin 81.1 ng·hr/mL). Glyburide Under steady-state conditions for glyburide, the addition of 36.3 mg daily of EXXUA for six days in 16 patients with stable Type II diabetes resulted in statistically significantly lower AUC (glyburide AUC 0-12 alone 574.8 ng·h/mL, with EXXUA 483.0 ng·h/mL) and C max (glyburide C max alone 121.0 ng/mL, with EXXUA 96.6 ng/mL) values for glyburide. Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis Following coadministration of stable dose of warfarin (INR 1.4 to 2.0) with multiple daily doses of EXXUA, no significant effect was observed in INR, prothrombin values, or total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics for warfarin. Drugs that Interfere with Protein Binding Gepirone is not highly bound to plasma protein and is not likely to be involved in interactions due to altered protein binding. In a clinical study with coadministration of EXXUA (18.2 mg) and warfarin, a highly protein-bound drug, no significant change in international normalized ratio (INR) was observed. In Vitro Studies Gepirone at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 ng/mL was shown to have no significant impact on the plasma protein binding of chlorpromazine, desipramine, diazepam, phenytoin, prazosin, propranolol, verapamil, or warfarin. The binding of digoxin and haloperidol were decreased (at maximum) by 5% and 9%, respectively. The plasma protein binding of lidocaine appeared to be increased by 4.9% in the presence of gepirone. Alcohol : An in vitro study showed dissolution rate for both 18.2 mg and 72.6 mg gepirone ER tablets decreased slightly as ethanol concentration increased in 0.01N HCl and 0.1N HCl at 0%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 40% alcohol. At 20 hours and 40% alcohol, approximately (mean) 76.8% and 80.7% were dissolved for the 18.2 mg and 72.6 mg gepirone ER tablets, respectively. Transporter Systems: EXXUA and its metabolites are unlikely to cause clinically significant inhibition of the following transporters based on in vitro data: P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K. As such, no clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized/transported by these CYP enzymes or transporters would be expected. Enzyme systems: In addition, EXXUA has not been shown to be an inhibitor or inducer of any of the cytochrome P450 enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Chronic administration of EXXUA is unlikely to induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by these CYP isoforms. figure1 figure 2']",['12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of the antidepressant effect of EXXUA is not fully understood but is thought to be related to its modulation of serotonergic activity in the CNS through selective agonist activity at 5HT1A receptors.'],"['12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacological activity of gepirone is attributed to the parent drug and its major metabolites 3’-OH-gepirone and 1-PP.

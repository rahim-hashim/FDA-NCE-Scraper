Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitomycin-C, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to radiation therapy and chemotherapy without atezolizumab.",NO,Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma|Muscle Invasive Bladder Carcinoma|Stage II Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IIIA Bladder Cancer AJCC v8,DRUG: Atezolizumab|PROCEDURE: Biopsy of Bladder|DRUG: Cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Gemcitabine|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|DRUG: Mitomycin|OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|OTHER: Survey Administration|PROCEDURE: Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor,"Bladder intact event-free survival (BI-EFS), At each time point, futility will be evaluated, and in the latter two analyses, efficacy will also be evaluated as specified. The final BI-EFS intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted using a stratified logrank test stratifying on stratification factors, and testing treatment at the one-sided significance level of 0.022 to account for multiple interim testing. The hazard ratio (HR) will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HR will be provided.

The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 induces immune tolerance, and the inhibition of this interaction is an effective treatment strategy for numerous malignancies.Despite its demonstrated potential, immunotherapy is not currently thought to be an effective intervention in the treatment of several immunologically ""cold"" tumors such as prostate cancer, biliary tract cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-triple negative breast cancer.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is thought to play a key role in modulating the anti-tumor immune response. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is secreted by tumors and leads to endothelial cell proliferation, vascular permeability, and vasodilation. This in turn leads to the development of an abnormal vasculature with excessive permeability and poor blood flow, limiting immune surveillance. In addition, VEGF inhibits dendritic cell differentiation, limiting the presentation of tumor antigens to CD4 and CD8 T cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) VEGF-TKIs are currently utilized in the treatment of a variety of malignancies and are widely utilized in combination with checkpoint blockade in the treatment of clear cell kidney cancer.Through the inhibition of VEGF, it may be possible to potentiate the effect of immune checkpoint blockade even in tumors which have traditionally been thought to be unresponsive to immunotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and the VEGF-TKI tivozanib in a variety of tumors which have a low response rate to checkpoint inhibitor therapy alone.",NO,Bile Duct Cancer|Gall Bladder Cancer|Breast Cancer|Neuroendocrine Tumors|Ovarian Cancer|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Vulvar Cancer|Prostate Cancer,DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tivozanib,"Objective response rate (ORR), To determine the best overall response rate (ORR) of atezolizumab plus tivozanib in subjects with immunologically cold tumors, 30 months","Progression free survival (PFS), To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with immunologically cold tumors receiving atezolizumab plus tivozanib, 30 months|Overall survival (OS), To determine the overall survival (OS) of subjects with immunologically cold tumors receiving atezolizumab plus tivozanib., 30 months|Disease control rate (DCR), To determine the disease control rate (DCR) of subjects with immunologically cold tumors receiving atezolizumab plus tivozanib.

Tecentriq,Tecentriq+bladder cancer,NCT03237780,Atezolizumab With or Without Eribulin Mesylate in Treating Patients With Recurrent Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03237780,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase II trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab with or without eribulin mesylate and how well they work in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has come back (recurrent), spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes (locally advanced), or spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

In mycosis fungoides, the disease is generally limited to the skin, and people develop flat or raised areas on their skin where the lymphocytes have accumulated. Sometimes even larger aggregations of lymphocytes occur in the skin or lymph nodes, resulting in tumors. In Sézary syndrome, the skin is often reddened or itchy, and some abnormal lymphocytes circulate in the blood.\* Lymphocytes are a type of immune cells that is made in the bone marrow and is found in the blood. Lymphocytes have a number of roles in the immune system, including the production of antibodies and other substances that fight infections and other diseases.In standard practice, the disease will be treated with conventional chemotherapy that unfortunately has a limited lasting benefit. In this study, we want to see if a new treatment option can optimize and improve response and make benefit last as long as possible. This new treatment option is immunotherapy, using atezolizumab (Tecentriq).Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal cells that may help cancer cell grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Atezolizumab blocks a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) from binding to its receptor found on the surface of lymphocytes. It helps to restore the immune activity of the body against the cancer.Atezolizumab is already used to treat adults with a cancer that affects the bladder and the urinary system, called urothelial carcinoma, and a cancer that affects the lungs, called non-small cell lung cancer.In this trial, patients will receive atezolizumab for one year unless the tumor starts growing again or this is not considered suitable for them anymore or they wish to stop the treatment.",NO,"Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous|Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome",DRUG: Atezolizumab,"Best overall response (CR+PR) rate (EORTC-ISCL-USCLC criteria), Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with global response score equal to CR or PR, Up to maximum 1 year starting from patient registration","Progression free survival (EORTC-International Society of Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL)-United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC) criteria), From registration to progression, 6 months as of Last Patient In (LPI)|Overall survival (OS), Registration till the date of death from any cause, 5 years as of LPI based on the median overall survival|Duration of response, From registration to progression, 6 months as of LPI|Time to response (CR/PR), From registration to progression, 6 months as of LPI|Time to next systemic treatment, Time from the end of the current atezolizumab treatment until the time the next systemic treatment is recorded., 8 months as of LPI",,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC,Hoffmann-La Roche,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,26,NETWORK,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,EORTC 1652-CLTF,2018-09-24,2021-03-11,2022-08-18,2017-11-29,,2024-02-22,"Hospital Universitario 12 De Octubre, Madrid, Spain|UniversitaetsSpital Zurich - Division of Dermatology, Zürich, Switzerland",,European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - EORTC | Hoffmann-La Roche,European Organisation For Research And Treatment Of Cancer  Eortc

Tecentriq,Tecentriq+bladder cancer,NCT03363867,BEACON - ABC in Recurrent Platinum Resistant HGSOC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03363867,BEACON,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the ninth most common cause of cancer in Australian women, with an estimated 1500 new diagnoses in Australia in 2015, and remains the seventh most common cause of cancer death in Australian women. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common form of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, and accounts for the most deaths due to a gynaecological cancer.The majority of women diagnosed with High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer present with advanced disease, and are typically managed with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite initial good response rates to chemotherapy, High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer recurs in up to 70% of patients who present with Stage III/IV disease.The purpose of this research project is to test how safe and effective the combination treatment of cobimetinib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab is as a treatment for patients with platinum resistant or refractory high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer.Cobimetinib is a drug that blocks a protein called Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK). MEK proteins are involved in the multiplication of cancer cells. By binding to the MEK protein, cobimetinib may help to stop the growth of your cancer cells.Bevacizumab is an antibody (a type of protein produced by the immune system) that is specifically designed to block a protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). VEGF is a protein that can increase the growth of tumour cells and binding to VEGF may help to stop the growth of tumours.Atezolizumab is a type of drug called a Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. PD-L1 binds to PD-1 which is a type of protein found on the surface of cells in your body's immune system, and it controls the ability of your body's natural immune response to trigger the death of tumour cells. Tumour cells can hide from the immune system by using PD-L1, which stops your immune system from triggering tumour cell death.Atezolizumab is a drug designed to block this PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by binding to PD-L1 so that PD-1 cannot bind to it and stops it from turning off your immune cells. This helps your immune system to recognise and destroy tumour cells. In turn, this potentially can stop or reverse the growth of your cancer.Cobimetinib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab have been used alone or in combination in the treatment of many other cancers. Each of them are individually licensed for the treatment of cancers such as advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer in Australia.

Tecentriq,Tecentriq+bladder cancer,NCT05564416,"Testing Anti-Cancer Drugs Erdafitinib With or Without Atezolizumab in Patients With Localized Bladder Cancer Not Able to Receive Cisplatin Chemotherapy, NERA Trial",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05564416,,WITHDRAWN,"This phase II trial compares the effect of erdafitinib alone to using the combination of erdafitinib and atezolizumab in treating patients with bladder cancer whose tumor invades the muscular bladder wall (muscle invasive)and who are ineligible for treatment with a chemotherapy drug called cisplatin. This trial also determines whether these treatment approaches are better than the usual approach for treating this type of cancer. The usual approach for treatment of someone with muscle invasive bladder cancer is chemotherapy with a drug called cisplatin followed by surgery (most common), or chemoradiation (radiation combined with chemotherapy) to the bladder (in some patients). However, half of the patients cannot get cisplatin due to safety concerns. This study has a screening step. The purpose of this step is to test patient's tumor to find out if it has a specific change (alteration) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene to determine patient's eligibility for this trial. Alteration of the FGFR gene causes bladder cancer cells to grow and divide abnormally. Erdafitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal FGFR protein. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving erdafitinib alone or in combination with atezolizumab may help to shrink tumor cells at the time of surgery better than the usual treatment in muscle invasive bladder cancer.",NO,Bladder Carcinoma|Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma|Muscle Invasive Bladder Carcinoma|Renal Pelvis and Ureter Urothelial Carcinoma|Stage II Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Stage III Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IVA Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Urothelial Carcinoma,BIOLOGICAL: Atezolizumab|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy|DRUG: Erdafitinib|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Pathological complete response (pCR), Will be compared between the two arms using one-sided Z test with unpooled variance.

Tecentriq,Tecentriq+bladder cancer,NCT04134000,Atezolizumab and BCG in High Risk BCG naïve Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) Patients (BladderGATE),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04134000,BladderGATE,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are usually managed by transurethral resection of their bladder tumor (TURBT) alone plus additional intravesical therapy to deliver high local concentrations of a therapeutic agent within the bladder, potentially destroying viable tumor cells that remain following TURBT. Although the exact mechanism of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) antitumor action is unknown, its intravesical instillation triggers a variety of local immune responses, which appear to correlate with antitumor activity. BCG induction plus maintenance is the current, guideline-recommended standard of care for high-risk NMIBC. Both recent evidence and guidelines suggest that full-dose BCG maintenance after the first BCG dose of induction course as used in the SWOG 8507 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30911 and 30962 trials, is the most appropriate maintenance schedule. High-risk NMIBC patients following adequate treatment have a recurrence rate at 1 and 2 years of 25 and 30% respectively after treatment with the current standard (BCG), which is clearly unsatisfactory. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a surface glycoprotein that functions as an inhibitor of T-cells and plays a crucial role in suppression of cellular immune response. It is implicated in tumor immune escape by inducing apoptosis of activated antigen-specific CD8 T-cells, impairing cytokine production and diminishing the toxicity of activated T-cells. PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry using the Ventana SP142 assay on tumor-infiltrating immune cell (IC) status defined by the percentage of PD-L1 positive ICs: IC0 (\<1%); IC1 (≥1% but\<5%); and IC2/3 (≥5%PD-L1) has been demonstrated to be higher (IC2/3) in resection and TURBT specimens versus biopsies from primary lesions or metastatic sites. In patients with metastatic bladder cancer, treatment with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab (1200 mg, every 3 weeks) resulted in objective response rates of 26% in the IC2/3 group, 18% in the IC1/2/3 group and 15% in all patients. The median overall survival was 11.4 months in the IC2/3 group, 8.8 months in the IC1/2/3, and 7.9 months in all patients. Grade 3-4 related treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16% and grade 3-4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 5% of treated patients. In murine models with invasive bladder cancer, anti-PD-1 plus CpG has shown to increase survival in mice, with anti-PD-1 plus CpG being superior to either agent alone.

Tecentriq,Tecentriq+bladder cancer,NCT03577132,The Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Treatment in Patients With Advanced Urothelial Bladder Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03577132,,UNKNOWN,"Recently, promising evidences that blocking PD-1 and PD-L1 is an efficacious way to treat advanced stage bladder cancer patients. Atezolimumab is the first PD-L1 inhibitor approved by US FDA for advanced UBC in June 2014. These novel agents will become the standard therapy for unhopeful UBC patients who fail to respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and finally, the first-line treatment would be changed from cisplatin-based chemotherapy to immune check point inhibitors for advanced UBC, particularly neoadjuvant setting.Additionally, along with enormous analysis of genomic landscape of bladder cancer, a consensus was reached regarding the existence of a group of Basal-Squamous-like tumors - designated BASQ - characterized the high expression of KRT5/6 and KRT14 and low/undetectable expression of FOXA1 and GATA3. This novel molecular classification can improve the identification of optimal patient population for different treatment modalities. Specifically, luminal type and basal type may have different treatment response and prognosis after initial definitive treatment, such as neoadjuvant treatments.However, there is no evidence for this topic, particularly the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-L1 inhibitors according to the BASQ classification in patients with advanced urothelial bladder cancer.",NO,Urothelial Carcinoma,DRUG: Neoadjuvant atezolizumab,"objective pathological responses (pT0 change), Final pathology of bladder after operation (radical cystectomy), 4weeks","progression-free survival at 1yr, progression-free survival at 1yr, 1year",,Seoul National University Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,SeoulNUHUro_Atezolizumab,2018-08-01,2020-05-31,2022-05-31,2018-07-05,,2018-07-31,,,Seoul National University Hospital | ,Seoul National University Hospital

However, response rates are low and no biomarkers have yet shown strong predictive value for patient selection. Moreover, the term 'metastatic' is based on metastases visible on conventional CT scans and, thus, require a certain size of tumour load. Clinical trials are currently being conducted that investigate the use of adjuvant immunotherapy for this group of patients (treatment to all), which will result in massive over-treatment and huge costs to the healthcare system.This project has the primary objective to identify new indications for initiating immunotherapy in patients with metastatic bladder cancer.

Balversa,Balversa+bladder cancer,NCT04963153,Testing Combination Erdafitinib and Enfortumab Vedotin in Metastatic Bladder Cancer After Treatment With Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04963153,,RECRUITING,"This phase Ib trial evaluates the best dose, potential benefits, and/or side effects of erdafitinib in combination with enfortumab vedotin in treating patients with bladder cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) and possesses genetic alterations in FGFR2/3 genes. Erdafitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal FGFR protein that signals cancer cells to multiply.

Standard of care treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer is chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor before the main treatment is given (neoadjuvant), followed by surgery to remove all of the bladder as well as nearby tissues and organs (radical cystectomy). In cases where patients are not candidates for the standard of care approach or prefer a bladder sparing option, tri-modality therapy with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy is used. Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of tumor cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor.

Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

PADCEV Injection is now available to treat this cancer.People in this study will be adults in South Korea with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. During their care, the person's doctor will have prescribed PADCEV Injection and other medicines to treat their cancer. People in the study will be treated according to their clinic's standard practice. This study is about collecting information only.This study will survey people who know they are receiving PADCEV Injection. The aims of the study are to check outcomes of treatment with PADCEV and record any medical problems during the study.Once a doctor has prescribed PADCEV Injection, a person in the study will be observed for up to 48 weeks (about 1 year) after their first dose. During this time, a person's medical records will be reviewed to check for any medical problems and to follow the condition of their cancer.

Pembrolizumab is a type of treatment that stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. The immune system is normally the body's first defense against threats like cancer. However, sometimes cancer cells produce signals like programmed death-1 (PD-1) that prevent the immune system from detecting and killing them. Pembrolizumab blocks PD-1 so your immune system can detect and attack cancer cells. To help further boost the cancer-fighting ability of your immune system, L-NMMA will be used along with pembrolizumab. L-NMMA is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The presence of nitric oxide synthase in the area around the cancer cells blocks the cancer-fighting ability of the immune system.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called govitecan. Sacituzumab attaches to TROP2 positive tumor cells in a targeted way and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving pembrolizumab and sacituzumab govitecan may be more effective than sacituzumab govitecan alone in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.",NO,Locally Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma,PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|BIOLOGICAL: Sacituzumab Govitecan,"Overall survival (OS), OS will be characterized with the method of Kaplan-Meier and will be compared between the two treatment arms using stratified log-rank test.

Developments in the last two decades suggest that bladder sparing therapy may be a valuable alternative to radical cystectomy. Currently, well-documented TMT regimens, which include complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, demonstrated durable oncologic control and long-term survival in selected patients. Nevertheless, TMT has not been widely used in clinical practice. On the one hand, due to the complexity of TMT, multiple clinical departments are required to cooperate in the assessment, treatment and follow-up of patients. On the other hand, concerns about tumor recurrence, lack of surgical intervention in regional lymph nodes, and organ dysfunction due to the treatment of large doses of pelvic radiation have reduced the clinical acceptance of TMT. In recent years, immunocheckpoint inhibitors such as PD-1/L1, including Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Tislelizumab, have proven to be promising immunotherapy approaches for advanced urothelium cancer, leading to breakthroughs in the treatment of advanced urothelium cancer. Immunocheckpoint inhibitors also showed positive efficacy in patients who did not respond to BCG treatment during perioperative period. Therefore, immunotherapy can be another means of bladder preservation after surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, bladder sparing target population is still unclear, among which, the NCCN guidelines recommend patients suitable for bladder preservation: T2-3N0M0, single lesion (longest diameter less than 6 cm), histological type of urothelial carcinoma, no CIS, and no hydronephrosis. Therefore, the focus of bladder preservation treatment is not only on the treatment before and during bladder preservation, but also on maximizing the follow-up treatment of TURBT and exploring its long-term benefits based on response to systematic treatment before maximized TURBT.",NO,Bladder Cancer,DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: gemcitabine and cisplatin|RADIATION: Modified hypofractionation,"BIDFS at one year, BIDFS, bladder intact disease free survival, was defined as the time from the start of regimen until MIBC recurrence, regional pelvic recurrence, distant metastasis, bladder cancer-related death, or cystectomy., one year","MFS at two years, MFS, metastatic free survival, was defined as time from the start of regimen to first diagnosis of distant metastasis, two years|BIDFS at two years, BIDFS, bladder intact disease free survival, was defined as the time from the start of regimen until MIBC recurrence, regional pelvic recurrence, distant metastasis, bladder cancer-related death, or cystectomy., two years|Treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, two years|cCR after first treatment stage, cCR, clinical complete response, defined as cT0, which is clarified as negative cystoscope, negative urine cytology and no disease evidence on imaging at the end of the first phase of treatment, and cTa, which is assessed as papillary bladder cancer by cystoscope, urine cytology and imaging., two years","utDNA, Urine tumor DNA analysis, two years",Fudan University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,ReBirth-01,2022-09-10,2024-09,2024-12,2022-09-07,,2024-07-12,"Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China",,Fudan University | ,Fudan University

The study drug, BAY 2416964, is a small molecule which blocks the AhR allowing the body to use its immune response against the cancer cells. Researchers think that BAY 2416964 given together with a cancer treatment called pembrolizumab may help shrink tumors in people with cancer.The main aims of this study are to find for BAY 2416964 in combination with pembrolizumab,* how safe this drug combination is* how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)* the highest amount of BAY 2416964 that can be given in combination with pembrolizumab without too many side effects.The researchers will also study the action of BAY 2416964 in combination with pembrolizumab against the cancer.The participants in this study will get BAY 2416964 and pembrolizumab. BAY 2416964 will be given by mouth. Pembrolizumab will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion. An IV infusion is given through a needle into a vein.This study will have two parts. The first part will help find the most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part.Each participant of the first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one specific dose group for BAY 2416964. The amount of BAY 2416964 that is given changes step-wise from one group to the next. The dose of pembrolizumab will always be the same.The participants of the second, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY 2416964 found in the first part.During the study, the participants will receive the treatment in 3-week periods called cycles. In each cycle, the participants will in general get pembrolizumab once and BAY 2416964 in a daily schedule. These 3-week cycles will be repeated throughout the trial.

It can be hard to study treatments for these diseases. One combination of drugs-enfortumab vedotin (EV) and pembrolizumab-has already been approved to treat some urinary cancers. Researchers want to see if they can help people with other types of testicle and urinary cancers.Objective:To test EV, with or without pembrolizumab, in patients with rarer cancers of the testicles or urinary tract.Eligibility:People aged 18 and older with rarer cancers of the testicles or urinary tract.Design:Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood and urine tests. Their ability to perform normal daily activities will be tested. They will have exams of their skin and eyes. They will have imaging scans. A biopsy may be needed: A sample of tissue will be removed from the tumor.The study drugs are both given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm. Some participants will receive treatments 3 times during 28-week cycles; others will receive treatments 2 times during 21-day cycles.All participants may continue to receive treatments for up to 5 years. Imaging scans and other tests will be repeated.Participants who stop taking the drugs will have follow-up visits every 3 to 4 weeks until the disease gets worse.

However, even though a subset of patients derives long-term benefit from these agents, depending of cancer type still at least half of patients do not respond to these new drugs. Our understanding of possible factors predicting whether a patient might actually benefit from immunotherapy is poor. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are gases exhaled with a person's breath, which are released into the lung from blood and bacteria and therefore can give information about infections as well as inflammation and possibly cancer cells in a person's body. Breath analysis of these VOCs with special devices called electronic noses (eNose) generate a specific electric signals patterns called breathprints. There is early evidence that specific breathprints can actually help to select patients who will be likely to benefit from immunotherapy.This study is being undertaken in an effort to evaluate breathprint analysis as a potential predicting factor for benefit from immunotherapy, so that treatment selection can further be improved.This study is designed to help us identify the role of breathprint analysis to better select patients for immunotherapy.",NO,NSCLC|Melanoma|Kidney Cancer|Urothelial Carcinoma|Head and Neck Cancer,OTHER: Breathprint analysis and patient-reported outcomes,"12 week Progression Rate in validation cohort, 12 weeks","Overall Survival (OS) in validation cohort, 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in validation cohort, 5 years","Progression-free survival (PFS) in validation cohort, 5 years|6 months clinical benefit rate (CR, PR or SD at 6 months after treatment start) in validation cohort, 6 months|12 week Progression Rate in exploratory cohorts, 12 weeks|OS in exploratory cohorts, 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in exploratory cohorts, 5 years|PFS in exploratory cohorts, 5 years|6 months clinical benefit rate in exploratory cohorts, 6 months","University Health Network, Toronto",University of Amsterdam,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,425,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,IO-Breathomics|19-5936,2020-02-24,2024-05,2024-05,2019-10-31,,2023-06-05,"Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada",,"University Health Network, Toronto | University of Amsterdam",University Health Network Toronto

Giving pembrolizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy may work better in treating participants with small cell/neuroendocrine cancers of the urothelium or prostate.",NO,Bladder Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma|Castration-Resistant Prostate Carcinoma|Metastatic Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma|Metastatic Urethral Urothelial Carcinoma|Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic in the Bone|Prostate Neuroendocrine Neoplasm|Prostate Small Cell Carcinoma|Stage III Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Stage III Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Stage III Urethral Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IV Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IV Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IV Urethral Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IVA Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Stage IVB Bladder Cancer AJCC v8|Ureter Small Cell Carcinoma|Urothelial Carcinoma,DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Etoposide|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab,"Durable response rate (DRR) (Cohorts 1 and 2), The statistical analyses will be primarily descriptive and exploratory.

MIBC is a type of cancer that has not spread from the muscles in the bladder to other parts of the body.MIBC is treated by having surgery to remove the bladder (cystectomy). Not all people choose to have surgery and want to keep their bladder using other treatments.Chemoradiotherapy (CRT)- is a type of non-surgical treatment for MIBC which combines Chemotherapy (a treatment with medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them growing) and Radiation therapy (a treatment that uses beams of intense energy \[like X-rays\] to shrink or get rid of tumors).Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer.A placebo looks like the study medicine but has no study medicine in it. Using a placebo helps researchers better understand if the study medicine works.The goal of this study is to learn: 1. If a study medicine pembrolizumab given with Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can help people live longer without their cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to placebo given with CRT. 2.About the safety and how well people tolerate CRT alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.",NO,Urinary Bladder Neoplasms,DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Conventional Radiotherapy (Bladder only)|RADIATION: Conventional Radiotherapy (Bladder and pelvic nodes)|RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiotherapy (Bladder only)|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Fluorouracil (5-FU)|DRUG: Mitomycin C (MMC)|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Placebo to Pembrolizumab,"Bladder Intact Event-Free Survival (BI-EFS), BI-EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: residual/recurrent MIBC post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT), nodal or distant metastases as assessed by computerized tomography (CT) and CT urography (CTU) or magnetic resonance urography (MRU) per blinded independent central review (BICR) and/or biopsy results assessed by central pathology review, radical cystectomy, or death due to any cause.

Keytruda,Keytruda+bladder cancer,NCT06341478,Investigator Grant (IG) 2022 27746,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06341478,,RECRUITING,"Background:Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a systemic disease as \>40% of patients (pts) ultimately develop recurrence after radical cystectomy (RC). For pts who cannot receive or refuse cisplatin-based chemotherapy there is no standard-of-care neoadjuvant therapy. Single-agent pembrolizumab, given neoadjuvantly in patients with T2-4N0M0 MIBC, documented a 42% pathologic complete response-rate (ypT0N0) in a previous AIRC-supported trial (PURE-01, NCT02736266; PMID: 30343614). However, there is a huge proportion of pts who do not benefit from single-agent immunotherapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) represent the next wave of MIBC treatment revolution. An umbrella of various neoadjuvant therapies including the ADC Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), SG plus pembrolizumab, and chemoimmunotherapy combination has been established to improve our knowledge on MIBC biology and to improve the outcomes.Hypothesis:By developing a robust biomarker program associated with therapeutic benefit of novel therapies or their combinations, along with an imaging biomarker development, the investigators will be able to identify suitable tumor characteristics for personalizing perioperative therapies in MIBC, coupled with the possibility to predict the pathological response to treatment.Aims:The project is aimed at characterizing the tumor and microenvironment characteristics of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, with a special focus on their changes induced by various neoadjuvant therapies preceding radical cystectomy.The investigators will aim to evaluate the tumor and immune profile on matched pre- vs post-therapy samples and noninvasively monitor the response to treatment with the use of radiological assessments.Experimental design:The investigators will access tumor samples from matched pre-therapy (transurethral resection of the bladder tumor) and post-therapy (radical cystectomy) surgical interventions. They will also analyze the imaging analyses of combined bladder multiparametric MRI/Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans pre-post neoadjuvant therapies, and will associate the data with the pathological response to treatment, expanding our previously reported work (PMID: 31882281).Biomarker analyses will include the following: i.) multiplex immunofluorescence assays will allow the investigators defining the immune contexture of tumor lesion; ii.) multiparametric flow cytometry will allow the phenotypic and functional analysis of peripheral blood cells at single cell level; iii.) a whole transcriptome assay will enable investigators to assign specific molecular subtypes to pathological response and outcome, as previously reported (PMID: 33785257; 32165065).Expected results:The investigators will expect to identify the tumor characteristics and immune-profiling enabling them to delineate the selection of patients most suited for certain novel perioperative therapies, thus anticipating the developments in clinical research that are being conducted worldwide in MIBC.The investigators will be also able to develop noninvasive tools for pathological complete response identification, thus enabling them to develop a next-generation of clinical trials aimed at sparing any radical local therapy on the bladder tumor.Impact on cancer:In principle, the present personalized strategy yields the potential to enhance the therapeutic standards achievable with RC alone as well as with single-agent immunotherapy and RC.",NO,Bladder Cancer,DRUG: various neoadjuvant therapies,"Predictors of immune response to experimental combination therapies in MIBC., Proportion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, PMN-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and intermediate monocytes (CD14+CD16+) in baseline blood samples of pathological complete responders compared to non-complete responders (pathological partial responders, pPR) and pathological nonresponders (pNR, ypT≥2N0 and ypN+)., Baseline (pre-therapy) to radical cystectomy|Genomic predictors of response to experimental combination therapies in MIBC., Proportion of gene mutations and fusions in baseline tumor samples of pathological complete responders compared to non-complete responders (pathological partial responders, pPR) and pathological nonresponders (pNR, ypT≥2N0 and ypN+)., Baseline (pre-therapy) to radical cystectomy|Transcriptomic predictors of response to experimental combination therapies in MIBC., Proportion of single gene or gene pathways signature scores in baseline tumor samples of pathological complete responders compared to non-complete responders (pathological partial responders, pPR) and pathological nonresponders (pNR, ypT≥2N0 and ypN+)., Baseline (pre-therapy) to radical cystectomy",,,IRCCS San Raffaele,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,153,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,IG-2022-27746,2024-03-15,2026-03-15,2027-03-15,2024-04-02,,2024-04-02,"IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Mi, 20132, Italy","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/78/NCT06341478/Prot_000.pdf",IRCCS San Raffaele | ,Irccs San Raffaele

The JAVELIN Bladder 100 and HCRN GU14-182 trials showed that maintenance immune checkpoint inhibition(ICI) for those that achieved disease control could prolong progression-free survival (overall survival benefit in JAVELIN may have been related to the lack of guaranteed crossover at time of progression). Of note, both of these studies showed consistency with regards to the magnitude of the PFS benefit which was \~40% vs \~20% at 6-months with maintenance ICI compared to BSC/placebo. Maintenance avelumab is now category 1 on the NCCN guidelines.However, some patients prefer prolonged chemotherapy responses and literature supports a treatment break without effecting longevity. The underlying risk resides in the selection of patients with some (currently difficult to diagnose) progressing rapidly. This trial proposes to use ctDNA to stratify chemo-responsive patients to active surveillance (i.e. a ctDNA responder referred to here as ""ctDNA-"") vs SOC maintenance pembrolizumab (ctDNA+).

On the other hand, not all patients are candidates for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and carboplatin is not comparable in activity, so there is an urgent need to find other drugs that may offer a therapeutic opportunity to these patients.In the context of metastatic disease, immunotherapy has been able to modify the natural history of this disease, administered as monotherapy, but the combination with double immune checkpoint inhibitors is also being evaluated with promising results. Even this therapeutic strategy is being advanced to the context of adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of urothelial tumors. In this sense, on the one hand, the present study, as a research in the neoadjuvant setting, constitutes the opportunity to define molecular phenotypes in bladder cancer since the design of this study will allow both, to evaluate the efficacy of the drug when the tumor is operable and to carry out an extensive analysis of biomarkers in the tumor tissue of these patients with an in-vivo evaluation of immune-based therapy activity. On the other hand, it allows to evaluate a strategy of double-immune checkpoint inhibitors that has already demonstrated activity in metastatic disease and, taking into account, the modest benefit of standard chemotherapy in the perioperative context: platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) Modest increase in overall survival, but only a subset of eligible patients are eligible to receive it.

Imfinzi,Imfinzi+bladder cancer,NCT03759496,Efficacy of Durvalumab in Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03759496,,UNKNOWN,"Research Hypothesis Approximately 75% of patients with bladder cancer (BC) present with a disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta, CIS) or submucosa (stage T1) (non-muscle invasive BC \[NMIBC\]). For high grade NMIBC, i.e. TaG3, T1G3 and CIS, intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy is the treatment of choice, given that it prevents recurrence and reduces the odds of progression to MIBC. However, since initial BCG therapy fails in approximately 40% of patients over a 2-year period, new treatment options for these patients are of utmost importance.In that field of research durvalumab, a human monoclonal antibody that binds programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), demonstrated meaningful clinical activity as well as manageable safety profile in PD-L1-positive patients with BC, many of whom were heavily pretreated. Certain studies using systemic administration of anti-PD1 agents for BCG refractory NMIBC are ongoing. Nevertheless, intravesical administration may be advantageous, since selective bladder tumor uptake of monoclonal antibodies following intravesical administration, while this method results in negligible absorption in the circulation and, therefore, minimal risk of systemic toxicity. This notion is supported by the findings of a recent study of intravesical administration of recombinant adenovirus-mediated interferon-α2b gene therapy (rAd-IFNα), No rAd-IFNα DNA was detected in the blood. Furthermore, no systemic toxicity was reported in a phase II study using the same agent.The investigators, therefore, propose a phase II study of intravesical administration of durvalumab in patients with BCG refractory NMIBC. Since no safety or efficacy data specifically on intravesical administration of durvalumab exist, a run-in part will precede the main phase II, in order to confirm safety of the procedure and to reject a futility hypothesis, as described in the following sections of the protocol. Correlative studies of potential biomarkers in tumor tissue before and after durvalumab instillation are also proposed.",NO,Bladder Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: Durvalumab,"The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Durvalumab among 500mg, 750mg and 1000mg that will be given intravesically to patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC, 6 months after trial initiation|The possibility of a rate of high-grade relapse free (HGFR) that it is defined as the development of TaG3, T1G3, CIS or muscle-invasive disease after the initiation of durvalumab therapy., 6 months after trial initiation|Efficacy of intravesical administration of Durvalumab at MTD in patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC assessed by 1-year high-grade-relapse-free (HGRF)-rate, 1 year after patient enrollment","Toxicity of the MTD of intravesical Durvalumab administration assessed according to the NCI CTC version 4.03 except from local irritation., Local irritation will be assessed according to the following criteria: Grade 1: Microscopic hematuria Grade 2: Moderate frequency.

Drugs used in standard chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cisplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Immunotherapy with durvalumab may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy with the addition of durvalumab may work better in helping tumors respond to treatment compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy alone.

Their SCCHN has spread around the area where the cancer first started. This is called locally-advanced SCCHN. These participants are eligible for surgery.Previous research with a similar therapy regimen resulted in high rates of cancer shrinkage, high rates of avoiding radiation and its side effects, high cure rate and good quality of life. Radiation can be very toxic. The purpose on this study is to try to avoid radiation. If the participants are not on this study they would be receiving radiation as it is standard treatment of their cancer. In the last study with a similar regimen, about a third of cancers had a pathologic complete response with the first part of the study. This means that the chemotherapy had killed the cancer. The investigators are trying to improve the regimen further with a goal of increasing this rate of complete response to the first part of therapy. The investigators also hope that by improving results in the first part, that more people will be cured and that long term quality of life (especially speech and swallowing) will be improved, both compared to standard therapies and to the last study. Doctors do not know how this therapy will effect the participants. There is no guarantee that this study will benefit the participants.The prior study used a combination of chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel and a third targeted anti-cancer drug. In this study the investigators are testing the combination of carboplatin, nano-albumin bound paclitaxel and durvalumab. Nano-albumin bound paclitaxel has been shown to be more active against other types of squamous cancers than regular paclitaxel. It is FDA approved for squamous lung cancer, but experimental for head and neck cancer. Durvalumab is an experimental drug that uses the body's own immune system to fight the cancer. Doctors hope that combining Durvalumab with 2 chemotherapy drugs will be effective in treating SCCHN. Durvalumab on its own has been studied in patients with SCCHN and initial results have shown that some subjects' cancer has responded to it.The purpose of this study is to test a combination of chemotherapy to hopefully both increase the number of subjects that respond to therapy while also decreasing the number of side effects that subjects experience.",YES,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell|Oral Cancer|Oropharynx Cancer|Larynx Cancer|Lip Cancer|Esophageal Cancer",DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection|RADIATION: IMRT,"Pathologic Complete Response Rate (pCRR) After Induction Chemotherapy With Carboplatin, Nab-paclitaxel, and Durvalumab in Previously Untreated Stage III and IV SCCHN Amenable to Surgical Resection, The pCRR was assessed via surgical pathology report.

However, many patients cannot receive standard therapy due to poor renal function, peripheral neuropathy, poor functional status, or clinically significant heart failure. Futibatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

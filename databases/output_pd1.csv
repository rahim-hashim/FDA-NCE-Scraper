Jemperli,https://www.drugs.com/jemperli.html,dostarlimab-gxly,,injection,Anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors),"Jemperli is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) endometrial cancer, and dMMR solid tumors. Jemperli belongs to the class of drugs called programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)–blocking antibodies. In healthy T-cells, PD-1 acts as a brake that prevents the cells from creating an out-of-control immune response, but in tumors, PD-1 can make T-cells inactive preventing them from killing cancer cells. Jemperli works in the treatment of dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer and dMMR solid tumors by binding to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells to block the interaction with the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, allowing the T-cells to activate and to attack and kill the cancer cells. ",,"Jemperli can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment with Jemperli has ended. Call or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any symptoms of the following problems or if these symptoms get worse: Lung problems (pneumonitis).

Signs of skin problems may include: Problems in other organs and tissues. These are not all of the signs and symptoms of immune system problems. Call or see your healthcare provider right away for any new or worse signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms of these problems may include: Infusion reactions that can sometimes be severe and life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of infusion reactions may include: Rejection of a transplanted organ. Your healthcare provider should tell you what signs and symptoms you should report and monitor you, depending on the type of organ transplant that you have had. Complications, including graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), in people who have received a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant that uses donor stem cells (allogeneic). These complications can be severe and can lead to death. These complications may happen if you underwent transplantation either before or after being treated with Jemperli. Your healthcare provider will monitor you for the following signs and symptoms: skin rash, liver inflammation, stomach area (abdominal) pain, and diarrhea.

Getting medical treatment right away may help keep these problems from becoming more serious.

Your healthcare provider will check you for these problems during treatment. Your healthcare provider may treat you with corticosteroid or hormone replacement medicines.

Keytruda,https://www.drugs.com/keytruda.html,pembrolizumab,,intravenous solution,Anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors),"Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a type of immunotherapy that is given by intravenous (into a vein) infusion over 30 minutes to treat many different types of cancer such as melanoma, lung cancer, and some lymphomas (see below for the full list of cancers Keytruda is approved for). It may be used alone or in combination with other medicines, including chemotherapy. Keytruda works by binding to and blocking the interaction of the PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) receptor with other proteins including PD-L1 and PD-L2. An upregulation of the PD-1 receptors occurs in some cancers and signaling through this pathway prevents the T-cells in our immune system from finding and attacking cancer cells. Animal studies have found that blocking PD-1 receptors helps the immune system to slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. Keytruda belongs to the class of monoclonal antibodies called PD-1 blocking antibodies. Keytruda may be used to treat: Keytruda is only approved for certain types of cancer and may require a specific treatment history. In some cases, the tumor may need to be tested for particular genetic markers like PD-L1, dMMR, TMB, or pMMR to determine if Keytruda is right for you.

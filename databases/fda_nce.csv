In most cases, by the time it has been diagnosed it has spread to other organs in the body and the chance of a cure is very small. The standard treatment for gastric cancer is a combination of chemotherapy drugs.* Researchers are interested in finding out if surgically removing all tumors before beginning chemotherapy for stomach cancer can slow or halt its spread better than giving chemotherapy alone.Objectives:- To determine whether tumor removal surgery followed by chemotherapy is more effective in treating gastric cancer than chemotherapy given alone.Eligibility:- Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with gastric cancer.Design:* All patients will undergo an initial physical examination, blood tests, imaging scans, and a laparoscopy to determine the extent of the disease.* Half of the participants will be assigned to have surgery first and then chemotherapy; the other half will be assigned to have chemotherapy alone.  * The surgery-plus-chemotherapy group will have major surgery to remove all tumors in the stomach and abdominal area, followed by a recovery time of up to 4 weeks. Chemotherapy will begin 6 to 8 weeks after surgery.  * The chemotherapy-only group will begin treatment within 2 weeks of laparoscopy.* All patients will receive four chemotherapy drugs: 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The drugs are given intravenously over 2 days every 2 weeks (one cycle) for 12 cycles (about 6 months), either at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center or at home with a referring oncologist. Patients in the surgery group who have tumors in the peritoneum will receive an additional set of chemotherapy drugs in a separate treatment.* During the chemotherapy cycles, patients will provide blood samples approximately once a week and will have physical examinations and scans on a regular basis.* Patients will return to the NIH Clinical Center for follow-up visits about every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years and yearly thereafter.",YES,Gastric Cancer,DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|PROCEDURE: Gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy,"Overall Survival in Patients With Limited Metastatic Gastric Carcinoma: Arm I, Time between the first day of treatment and the date of death., 12 weeks up to 3 years|Overall Survival in Patients With Limited Metastatic Gastric Carcinoma: Arm II, Time between the first day of treatment and the date of death, 12 weeks up to 3 years","Number of Participants With Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0).

Pain intensity is reported by patients with chronic pain as one of the most important targets of treatment, and daily pain intensity ratings are a recommended core outcome measure for clinical trials of treatments for chronic pain. Daily ratings are preferable to ratings of recalled pain over longer time periods such as a week, as daily ratings minimize the influence of recall biases (Dworkin et al., 2005). Participants provide one-daily reports (at the end of the day) of their average knee pain intensity on a 0-10 pain intensity NRS over the course of a week, and those daily ratings are averaged to compute a mean knee pain intensity score. Participants will record their Daily Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0-10 each day for one week prior to each clinic visit using NEForm., 24 Weeks|Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC-C), WOMAC-C (Function subscale) (Bellamy et al, 1988). The WOMAC-physical function subscale contains 17 items assessing daily functioning, each using an 11-point (0 to 10) numerical rating scale. The total index score (0-170) is the sum of the items. A higher WOMAC function score represents worse functioning and less ability to engage in daily activities., 24 Weeks|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The HADS is a 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in those with medical illness (Norton et al, 2013). This scale has 14 items, 7 related to anxiety and 7 to depression, rated on 4 points (0 to 3) in domains of intensity or frequency. Scoring is done separately for depression and for anxiety and each domain is interpreted as normal for scores of 0-7, borderline abnormal (borderline case) for scores of 8-10 and abnormal (case) for scores of 11-21. This scale is used to assess depression and anxiety in addition to HEAL/EPPIC-Net core data elements (CDEs) because of its higher sensitivity to change especially in patients with medical illnesses., 24 Weeks|PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale - 6A, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale - 6A (Yu et al, 2011). Sleep disruption has a bi-directional relationship with chronic pain and is an important secondary outcome to measure in pain trials (Edwards et al, 2016). The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance short form is a convenient 6-item scale that correlates strongly with the longer forms. It shows greater measurement precision for assessing sleep disturbance than other commonly-used (and much longer) questionnaires such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale; its brevity and convenience are a major advantage for both research and clinical settings (Yu et al, 2011). The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale is expressed as a T-score, with a population mean of 50 and SD of 10. Possible T scores in this distribution range from 31.7 to 76.1., 24 Weeks|Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), The PGIC is a single-item measure of patient-reported improvement that is widely used as a general outcome measure in studies of chronic pain patients, including OA patients (Salaff et al, 2004). It is often used as an index of treatment-associated change, and patient-reported improvements in the form of PGIC scores correlate robustly with significant improvement in pain intensity, pain interference with activities of daily living, mood, and quality of life (Perrot and Lanteri-Minet, 2019)., 24 Weeks|Staircase-evoked pain assessment, This procedure consists of stepping fully up and down onto an 8in (20.32cm) high platform with both feet a total of 24 times. The lead leg is alternated between each up/down cycle. Subjects are instructed to use their normal gait for completing this task and are encouraged to complete the task despite increasing pain, without stopping if possible. The procedure is timed, and current knee pain intensity on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is assessed immediately before and following the procedure while the subject is in a seated, resting position., 24 Weeks|Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines, These will be assessed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period (weeks 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24).Serum levels are measured in Picograms per millilitre (pg/mL). Serum analysis will include cytokines and chemokines as a part of establishing biomarker for treatment of OA pain with CNTX-6970., 24 Weeks|MCP-1/CCR-2, Monocyte chemoattractant serum protein-1(MCP-1)/CCR-2 receptor binding inhibition by CNTX-6970. This will be assessed at baseline and at the end of each treatment period (weeks 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24). This test provides a single score, expressed as a percentage, 0-100%, with higher scores indicating more binding inhibition., 24 Weeks",,"Maurizio Fava, MD",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,77,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2021p002273 (EN20-01),2021-10-25,2024-06-11,2024-06-11,2021-08-27,,2024-09-19,"University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|University of California- Davis, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32611, United States|M&M Clinical Trials, Miami, Florida, 33185, United States|Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Healthcare Research Network, Hazelwood, Missouri, 63042, United States|Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, 10467, United States|New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, 10016, United States|Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, 10029, United States|University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, 14618, United States|Center for Clinical Research, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27103, United States|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19146, United States|University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15206, United States|UTsouthwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, United States|University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, 98195, United States|University of Wisconsin- Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, 53715-1218, United States",,Maurizio Fava Md
